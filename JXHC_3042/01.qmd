[First, working memory has **limited capacity**. Think of it as the set of resources for temporarily holding and manipulating information. Analogy used often: a working desk.]{.fragment}

[Second, working memory consists of **multiple components**. Different components handle different types of information (e.g., visuo-spatial, verbal-phonological) or manage access to information.]{.fragment}

We will review these features in turn.

# Working memory's limited capacity


Classic **span** tasks measure simple short-term storage: participants hear or see sequences of items (digits, letters, words) and must recall them in order. Span is the _maximum number of items_ a person can correctly repeat, often reported to be around 7 +- 2.

# Optional: Demo of digit span task
