[We will review these features in turn.]{.fragment}



# Working memory has limited capacity (feature #1)

Think of working memory as the set of resources for temporarily _holding_ and _manipulating_ information. 

:::{.fragment}

Analogy used often: a working desk. There is enough space for the things you are working on right now, not much else...

<div style="text-align: center;">

# Desk analogy {auto-animate=true}

<div class="container">
  <div class="rect whole" data-id="whole" 
        style="width:50%; height:100%"></div>
</div>

The white rectangle is the desk, representing how much working memory is being used at this moment. [Currently: unlikely/impossible situation where nothing is taking space in working memory]{.fragment}


# Desk analogy {auto-animate=true}


<div class="container">
  <div class="rect whole" data-id="whole"

  <div class="rect used" data-id="used"
       style="width:25%; height:80%;"></div>
</div>

Most of the times (or always) something occupies space on the desk: the things that are in the working memory. [Sometimes one has enough working memory capacity spare to do well whatever it is that one is doing.]{.fragment}

# Desk analogy {auto-animate=true}

<div class="container">
  <div class="rect whole" data-id="whole"

  <div class="rect used" data-id="used"
       style="width:55%; height:100%; background:rgba(255,40,0,0.6)"></div>
</div>

Other times, there's too much in working memory and the system fails due to overload (running out of cognitive resources). [Whatever one is doing is going to suffer in quality.]{.fragment}


# Measuring working memory capacity: span

_Classic_ span tasks measure primarily (short-term) storage capacity: [participants hear or see sequences of items (digits, letters, words)]{.fragment} [and must recall them in order.]{.fragment} [**Span** is the _maximum number of items_ a person can correctly repeat, often reported to be around 7 +- 2.]{.fragment}

[These tasks involve mainly two relatively-simple processes: encoding and recall.]{.fragment}

Three different components handle storage of information (e.g., visuo-spatial, verbal-phonological) or manage access to that information.

```{dot}

    A [label="central executive"];
    B [label="phonological loop"];
    C [label="visuospatial sketchpad"];

    A -> {B; C} [dir="both"]
    
    
}
```

:::
::::

# House windows exercise

Helpful to realize how the three components work together.

Take a couple of minutes to **work out how many windows are there in your house** 

- You retreive from long-term memory and manipulate a mental image of your house as you “walk through” it room by room (_visuospatial sketchpad_)

- As you progress, you keep a count of the number of windows by rehearsing the numbers out loud or not. (_phonological loop_)

- You will have followed a strategy: deciding which rooms to visualize next, keeping track of progress, and ensuring the count is updated (_central executive_).


# Combining the two features: Measuring component-specific capacity

**Phonological/Verbal Working Memory:**

- _Digit Span_: Recall sequences of digits in order
- _Letter Span_: Recall sequences of letters in order
- _Word Span_: Recall sequences of words in order

**Visuospatial Working Memory:**

- _Corsi Block Tapping Test_: Recall sequences of spatial locations. [Optional: <a href="https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_corsi2.html">link to Corsi span test</a>]{.fragment}
- _Visual Patterns Test_: Recall patterns in a grid



# Optional: Complex span tasks 

**Classic** span tasks = measure _how much_ you can hold.

**Complex** span tasks = measure how well you can hold information _while doing something else_.

[They require to:]{.fragment}

- resist interference from additioanl processing task 
- keep the memory items active

[Compared to classic span tasks, better association with higher-order cognition (executive functions)]{.fragment}

[Working memory's limited capacity (feature #1) implies that one can't process all information at once. One needs to **select**...]{.fragment} [ and that's one of the things attention does]{.fragment}

# Orienting of attention: overt vs covert

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
**Overt**

- observable orienting movement of sense organs/body
- attention shifts with sensor orientation (eyes, head/ears, posture)
- typically detectable by others

<div style="font-size:0.7em">
- examples:
    - visual: turning eyes/head to look at a clock
    - auditory: turning your head or cupping your ear toward a speaker
    - tactile/proprioceptive: moving a finger to explore a texture
</div>

:::
:::{.column}
**Covert**

- internal shift of focus without observable movement
- attention shifts without changing sensor orientation
- typically not detectable by others

<div style="font-size:0.7em">
- examples:
    - visual: keeping eyes fixed but monitoring something in peripheral vision
    - auditory: keeping head still but following a conversation behind you
    - tactile/proprioceptive: keeping the hand still but focusing on the pressure of a ring

Goal-directed orienting can happen overtly or covertly.
Stimulus-driven orienting can also happen overtly or covertly.

Study 1, key methodology

- N = 30 University students
- **Task**: Use one hand to classify central and peripheral target stimuli [(perceptually difficult because the target stimuli were presented for a short duration)]{.fragment}
- Participants needed to keep their eyes on a central fixation cross. A target stimulus could appear either centrally or in the periphery [... or both: dual trial (i.e., two targets at the same time)]{.fragment}
- **Groups**: arousal, non-arousal
- The other hand was for receiving _electrical shocks_ every now and then, but only the lucky ones in the arousal group.
- Analyses: the researchers were interested in the participants' choices in the dual trials.

# Summary of effects of anxiety on attention: Attentional Bias

Anxiety induces an **attentional bias**, consisting of enhanced processing of threats:

- _early detection_ of threats 
- _impaired disengagement_ from threats 

[(whatever threat means to the individual).]{.fragment}

<br><br>

[Good or bad?]{.fragment} [Neither. From an evolutionary perspective, anxiety is an adaptive process that increase chances of survival.]{.fragment} [But thinking about threats might not always be the most functional way to use one's working memory resources.]{.fragment}

# Processing Efficiency Theory (PET) {auto-animate=true}

  <div class="rect whole" data-id="whole" 
       style="width:50%; height:100%"></div>

  <div class="rect task" data-id="task"
       style="width:25%; height:60%;"></div>
</div>

There are plenty of resources (white) to complete an easy task (yellow). Performance is good.

  <div class="rect task" data-id="task"
       style="width:25%; height:60%;"></div>
</div>

Resources dedicated to worry (blue) are not dedicated to process task-related information.
[But there are plenty resources for both. Performance is good.]{.fragment}

  <div class="rect task" data-id="task"
       style="width:25%; height:60%;"></div>
</div>

If worry takes more resources (i.e., one experiences greater cognitive anxiety), [while still leaving enough for the easy task, there is still space for both.]{.fragment} [Performance is still not impaired.]{.fragment}

# Processing Efficiency Theory (PET) {auto-animate=true}

<div class="container">

  <div class="rect task" data-id="task"
       style="width:45%; height:60%;"></div>
</div>

But if the _task is more difficult_ requiring more resources, [and if there are none left,]{.fragment} [performance will be impaired.]{.fragment}

[Performance is impared if there are not enough resources to carry out the task.]{.fragment} [Worry is a _distraction_ that takes resources away from the task]{.fragment}

# Processing Efficiency Theory (PET) {auto-animate=true}

<div class="container">
  <div class="rect whole" data-id="whole" 
        style="width:70%; height:100%"></div>
  <div class="rect used" data-id="used"
       style="width:50%; height:100%;"></div>
  <div class="rect task" data-id="task"
       style="width:45%; height:60%;"></div>
</div>

However, working memory capacity can temporary increase, through _effort_ mobilization. [There are now enough resources for both the worry and the task. Performance is good.]{.fragment} [However, the fact that _extra resources_ were mobilized means _decreased efficiency_.]{.fragment}



# Processing Efficiency Theory (PET) {auto-animate=true}

<div class="container">
  <div class="rect whole" data-id="whole" 
        style="width:50%; height:100%"></div>
  <div class="rect used" data-id="used"
       style="width:1%; height:1%;"></div>
  <div class="rect task" data-id="task"
       style="left:10%; width:45%; height:60%;"></div>
</div>

In fact, even a task so difficult could have been carried out well in a more efficient manner (i.e., without the extra effort) if worry did not occupy so much of working memory.

# Processing Efficiency Theory (PET) 

The effects of worry (cognitive anxiety) are best studied not on performance, but on _processing efficiency_.

:::{.fragment}
::: {.callout-note}
Optional: my interpretation
$$
\text{efficiency} \propto \frac{\text{performance}}{\text{resources}}
$$

The formula is a short version of "how much you do in relation with how much effort you put tells about efficiency". The symbol $\propto$ means "is proportional to".

  - Performance (through video analyses)
- Analysis factors
  - Group (low, high trait anxiety)
  - set criticality
    - low: 7 or more points of difference
    - moderate: between 3 and 6 points of difference
    - high: less than 2 points of difference

Predictions:

- State anxiety would be greater for more critical sets
- Effort would also be greater for more critical sets
- Performance would increase when more effort is mobilized
  - but only for the low-trait anxiety group

Main results:

- High-trait anxiety groups experienced greater state anxiety

"Quiet Eye" as much a phenomenon as a variable.

<br>

As a _variable_

- The QE is a duration of time, units of (milli)seconds
- Eyes on the critical location or object (e.g., ball in golf putting)
- It starts before movement initiation (“QE onset”)
- It ends when the gaze deviates from the location or object of a certain amount (“QE offset”)


As a _phenomenon_

[Extensive reports in literature that:]{.fragment}

- experts have a longer QE than novices
- QE is longer for successful than unsuccessful performance
- it is trainable

# Wilson et al. (2006) {.scrollable}


Key methodology:

- N = 24 university students
  - Median split into low and high trait anxiety
- Task: simulated rally driving, under two conditions
  - practice (designed to induce lower state anxiety)
  - competition (designed to induce higher state anxiety)
- Measures:
  - Trait and state anxiety (through questionnaires)
  - Effort mobilized (through questionnaire)
  - Performance (time to complete the race)
  - Effort 
    - through questionnaire
    - pupil diameter (larger pupil = more effort)

Main results:

- for both groups, state anxiety increased from practice to competition.
- the high-trait anxiety group showed greater state anxiety.

- Pupil diameter increased from practice to competition for both groups, [being also larger for high-trait anxiety group]{.fragment}

- Self-report effort showed similar results, with the practice-to-competition increase much larger in the high-trait anxiety group.

- No group difference in performance during practice
- Performance decreased from practice to competition
- Performance drop was larger for the high-trait anxiety group

Interpretation: 

- There were enough spare resources in working memory to complete the driving task when worry (state anxiety) used a small amount of resources.

- Worry (state anxiety) occupied more resources in competition, especially for the high-trait anxiety group.

- The high-trait anxiety group mobilized more resources, increasing their working memory, but the extra resources were not enough to maintain as good performance.

- These findings support Processing Efficiency Theory

## Part 2 of 2 {.nostretch .center}



# Agenda

- Brief recap of Procesing Efficiency Theory
- Brief review of executive functions and revisiting Alan Baddeley's model of working memory
- Attentional Control Theory
- Gaze training
- Cognitive training
- Mixture of theory, empirical research, and intuition


# Very brief recap of Processing Efficiency Theory

People who experience greater cognitive anxiety (worry) perform worse than those who experience less. But this is not always the case... why?

- There is not enough space in the working memory to process everything
- Our attention selects information to be processed
- Working memory and attention are not unitary concepts
- **Cognitive anxiety (worry) does not necessarily reduce performance**
- Effort can counteract the impairment **at the expense of processing efficiency**
- Cognitive anxiety (worry) reduces processing efficiency

# Executive functions {.scrollable}

Alan Baddeley's initial model of Working Memory was later expanded to include at-the-time improved understanding of executive functions.

Overall resources (in white) are temporarily increased through **greater effort**. Performance of the task (yellow) is not impaired despite the large worry (blue). **Efficiency decreases**.


# ACT hypothesis 2: task demands {auto-animate=true .scrollable}

**The more difficult the task, the higher the chances of decreased efficiency**

       style="width:5%; height:100%; bottom:0; left:45%; opacity:0.5"></div>
</div>

If the task is **easy** (i.e., it requires not many Working Memory resources), the effects of worry on efficiency are not visible (no need to put extra effort).

# ACT hypothesis 4: inhibition

How is attentional control disrupted (hypothesis 3) under elevated cognitive anxiety? Through **impaired inhibition**

- Impaired inhibition enhances the stimulus-driven path to attentional orienting
- One becomes unable to block out irrelevant information
- Potential distractions (non-task related activity) intrude in one's attention


# ACT hypothesis 5: shifting

How is attentional control disrupted (hypothesis 3) under elevated cognitive anxiety? Through **impaired shifting**

- Impaired shifting decreases the goal-directed path to attentional orienting
- One becomes unable to focus on the relevant information
- Potential important information (task related activity) are not in one's focus

# ACT hypothesis 6: updating

How is attentional control disrupted (hypothesis 3) under elevated cognitive anxiety? Through **impaired shifting**

- When the Working Memory is overloaded, it loses the ability to update and monitor information
- One fails to keep track of changing task demands
- Processing becomes less flexible and adaptive

# Wilson et al. (2009) {.scrollable}

Key idea: 

- Quiet Eye duration as measure of attentional control
- Does anxiety impair QE durations?

[Key methodology:]{.fragment}

- N = 10 university students (basketball players)
- Task: free throws until 10 hits and 10 misses
- Conditions:
  - Control (low pressure)
  - Experimental (high pressure, competition and financial incentive)
- Measures:
  - State anxiety, through questionnaire
  - Quiet Eye duration, through eye tracking

Key results:

# Interventions: Gaze training {.scrollable}

What is it: Training to exhibit a longer quiet eye duration, specifically under greater cognitive anxiety (worry).

<br><br>

[ACT-specific mechanisms that it fixes:]{.fragment}

- Quiet Eye duration as index of dominance of goal-directed orienting (more concentration) over stimulus-driven orienting (more distraction)
- Training for a longer Quiet Eye duration allows greater goal-directed and less stimulus-driven orienting

[Caveats to consider for the success of training:]{.fragment}

- Most experts already have long Quiet Eye durations, at least in low-pressure situations
- Not for all sports it is easy to identify where the visual focus should be and for how long

# Interventions: Cognitive training

What is it: Training to increase your working memory capacity (i.e., the desk from the analogy).

<br><br>

[ACT-specific mechanisms that it fixes:]{.fragment}

- Anxiety (worry) occupies resources from working memory, conflicting with resources that should be dedicated to task-related processing
- A permanently larger working memory capacity would increase the chances that, despite worry taking resources, there would be enough left for processing task-related information.

[Caveats to consider for the success of training:]{.fragment}

- Tranferrability to real-world tasks

Training protocol instructions

::::{.columns}  
:::{.column}

Technical instructions:

- Stand with legs hip width apart and keep your head still.
- Maintain relaxation of shoulders and arms.
- Keep the putter head square to the ball.
- Perform a pendulum-like swing and accelerate through the ball.
- Maintain a still head after contact.

:::

:::{.column}

Quiet Eye training instructions

- Assume stance and ensure that gaze is on the back of the ball.
- Fixate the hole. (Fixation should be made no more than three times.)
- Your final fixation should be on the back of the ball and for not longer than 2-3 seconds.
- No gaze should be directed to the club head or shaft during the putting action.
- Your fixation should remain steady for 200-300 ns after contact with the ball.

No performance differences at pre-test (before training).

Performance overall improving for both groups.

No obvious performance advantage on one group over the other.

Quiet Eye durations were as expected:

- equal between groups at pre-test
- longer for the QE group, at the post-tests

Performance was comparable across groups at all retention post-tests, [except at _transfer_ (high pressure performance), where the technical but not the Quiet Eye group showed a significant drop in performance]{.fragment}

- Some _pre_ and _post_-test measures:
  - attentional control through rest state electroencephalography (EEG)
  - Flanker task performance [(<a href="https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_flanker_arrows.html">Link to Flanker task</a>)]{.fragment}, under anxiety-inducing conditions (loud and unpredictable noise bursts)


[Training explanations:]{.fragment}

- visual n-back: one 3x3 grid is presented at the time with only once cell illuminated. Participants need to respon when the same grid was presented n trials before.
- phonological n-back: one letter is pronounced at the time. Participants need to respon when the same letter was presented n trials before. [(<a href="https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_touch_nback2.html">Link to classic visual letter n-back</a>)]{.fragment}
- dual n-back: visual and phonological stimuli are presented simultaneously. Trials can match visually (press a key), phonologically (press another key), or both (press both keys)
- adaptive dual n-back: the number _n_ increased or decreased at the next block depending on accuracy at the previous block. [Consult the paper for a figure of the stimuli]{.fragment}
- Schedule: 15 sessions in 21 days

[Some key results]{.fragment}

- the adaptive group reached high levels of complexity (large _n_ in b-back)
- The adaptive group showed better Flanker task performance under conditions of elevated state anxiety
- The adaptive group showed larger values of EEG indices associated with better attentional control
- Cognitive training improved attentional control under pressure / resilience of attentional control to pressure
