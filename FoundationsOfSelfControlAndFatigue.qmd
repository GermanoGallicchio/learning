# Strength model of self-control {.scrollable}

**Self-control**, also known as "willpower" or "self-discipline" is the capacity to control behaviour in line with long-term benefits, personal values, or social expectations. 

[The **strength model** of self-control posits that self-control is a limited resource, operating like a muscle: it can be fatigued and it can be trained.]{.fragment fragment-index=0}

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}

[Each use of self-control depletes a common tank of self-control resources.]{.fragment fragment-index=1}

[When self-control resources are running low (the tank is almost dry) the individual is in a state of **ego depletion**.]{.fragment fragment-index=3}


[Ego depletion is a temporary state, characterized by exhaustion (or near exhaustion) of self-control.]{.fragment fragment-index=4}
[It has detrimental effects on activities requiring self-control.]{.fragment fragment-index=5}

# Approaches to measuring self-control

Two approaches have been used to measure self-control:

1. through questionnaires. [(potential issues: subjective? social desirability?)]{.fragment}
2. through performance at a second self-control activity (the two-task paradigm), presented straight after another self-control activity.

[These approaches, especially the latter, have provided substantial (but controversial) support to the strength model of self-control.]{.fragment}

# Ego depletion: from consensus to controversy {.scrollable}

While the concept of self-control itself is well established and unanimously recognized, the strenght model of self-control, and especially the concept of ego depletion, has been seriously questioned.

[Early success]{.fragment}

- Baumeister's initial studies showed robust ego depletion effects
- Many research groups used the two-task paradigm and replicated the findings
- Hagger et al. (2010) meta-analysis: 198 studies, moderate-to-large effect size (d = 0.62)
- The strength model became widely accepted.

[Doubts emerge]{.fragment}

- It became known that some labs struggled to replicate the effect
- Questions about publication bias (only positive results published? "File drawer problem")
- Concerns about small sample sizes and flexible analysis
<!-- **Job et al. (2010)**: Beliefs about willpower moderate the effect -->

[Failed replication]{.fragment}

- Hagger et al. (2016): Multi-lab registered replication
- 23 labs, 2,141 participants, pre-registered protocol
- Result: Near-zero effect size (d = 0.04)
- Ego depletion effect essentially disappeared under rigorous conditions

# Limitations of the strength model of self-control

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}

[Limitation 1: **what is to be depleted?**]{.fragment}

[The depletion of common resources was an interesting concept,]{.fragment}
[but what is the biological resource that is depleted in "ego depletion"?]{.fragment}
[Nobody found that (although glicemia was considered for a while).]{.fragment}

[What if nothing depletes, but something accumulates instead?]{.fragment}

:::
:::{.column}

[Limitation 2: **the role of motivation**]{.fragment}

[Incentives can counter the effects of ego-depletion, therefore depletion might reflect reduced motivation]{.fragment}
[Participants might expect to feel tired after effortful and/or boring tasks, they would disengage, and put in less effort (rather than becoming unable to perform).]{.fragment}

[Could the perception of effort influence fatigue?]{.fragment}

:::
::::

[An alternative to the strength model that emerged from critiques of ego depletion is the "Psychobiological model of fatigue".]{.fragment}

# Psychobiological model of fatigue {.scrollable}

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}

A. Effort

  1. Assume you are engaging with a challenging activity, mentally or physically.

  2. Certain brain regions (e.g., those involved in executive functions) keep track of how hard the task feels, and you realize how much effort you are putting in.

B. Tolerance

  1. You have an idea of how much effort you are willing to tolerate 
  
  2. Motivation can raise or lower the tolerance threshold.

C. Perceived effort + Motivation = Decision

  1. If effort is below the threshold, you continue the task and keep going.

  2. If effort meets or exceeds the threshold, you stop or reduce performance.

Key ideas: 

- Fatigue is produced by the _interplay_ between the conscious **perception of effort** and the **motivation-modulated tolerance** (willingness to exert that effort)
- Effort is typically retracted much earlier than resources running out
- Effort is retracted when perceived effort is greater than an individual's maximum tolerable level
- Typically, stopping is a _decision_, not a physiological necessity

[Role of motivation:]{.fragment}

- Strong motivation raises the tolerance threshold
- Incentives (e.g., extrinsic motivation) can counter "depletion" effects

# The "exercise stopper" {.scrollable}

A substantial part of the psychobiological model was developed to understand _what makes people stop exercise_.

[Initial findings focused on physiology (e.g., accumulation of metabolites), but findings revealed people could persist/desist depending on their motivation and effort tolerance.]{.fragment}

[Studies manipulating incentives and their timings suggested the exercise stopper was perception of _effort being too high relative to effort tolerance_.]{.fragment}

# Some evidence supporting the psychobiological model {.scrollable}


1. Mental fatigue reduces endurance performance

- Participants do cognitively demanding tasks (90 min)
- Then perform physical endurance test (cycling to exhaustion)
- Result: Quit sooner despite same physiological state
- They _felt_ more tired, but weren't physiologically more depleted

2. Subliminal priming studies

- Flash words like "go", "energy", "action" below awareness threshold
- Improves endurance performance
- No physiological changes, only perception altered

3. Brain stimulation (tDCS) studies

- Transcranial direct current stimulation to reduce effort perception
- Participants can exercise longer
- Same physiological capacity, different perception

4. Incentive studies

- Money eliminates "ego depletion"
- increased motivation can lead to higher effort tolerance
- Fits psychobiological model, contradicts resource depletion

Case study:

> **Maya** is training for a marathon. During her long training runs, she often feels like quitting around the 15-km mark, even though she knows her body is capable of continuing. Some days she pushes through; other days she stops early.

Reflect on:

1. from the **strength model** perspective: What might explain Maya's _difficulty continuing_? What advice would you give her?

2. from the **psychobiological model** perspective: What might explain Maya's _variable performance_? What advice would you give her?

3. Which model better explains why Maya's performance _varies from day to day_?

4. Practical application: Based on either model, suggest specific strategies Maya could use to improve her endurance.

Key methodology:

- participants: 92 adults
- 4 groups, random allocation:
  a. avoid sweets (high self-control)
  b. handgrip exercises (high self-control)
  c. math exercises (low self-control)
  d. write diary (low self-control)
  - for 2 weeks
- assessment of inhibition ability before and after group allocation, using the Stop Signal Task

Key finding:

:::{.fragment}
> Participants who practiced self-control
by cutting back on sweets or squeezing a handgrip exhibited significant improvement in stop signal performance relative to those who practiced tasks that did not require self-control.

Key methodology:

- participants: 36 adults
  - 2 groups, random allocation:
    a. brain-endurance training (handgrip and executive function tasks)
    b. control (only handgrip tasks)
    - for six weeks
- rhythmic endurance handgrip task 
  - before and after training
  - under three conditions: solo, after, or concurrent to an executive function task (n-back)
- Key measures:
  - endurance performance
  - prefrontal cortex functionality (fNIRS)

[Key findings:]{.fragment}

- The experimental group improved endurance more than control group
- Experimental group developed greater prefrontal cortex functionality than control group
