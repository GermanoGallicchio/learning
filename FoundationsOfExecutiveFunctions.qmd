# What cortical regions are fundamental to executive funtcions?

Executive functions rely on a _distributed network_, involving several cortical and subcortical regions involved. [But traditionally, the **prefrontal cortex** (often shortened as PFC) is attributed a key role within this network.]{.fragment}

Key cortical regions involved:

- dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Some functions: working memory, goal maintenance, planning and top‑down control.

- ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). Some functions: response selection, inhibition, and controlled retrieval.

- orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Some functions: value representation, reward-guided decision making and impulse control

- anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) 
[Note: this is structurally just outside the prefrontal cortex but it works in synergy with it]{.fragment} 
[Some functions: conflict monitoring, error detection, and performance adjustment].{fragment}

- parietal cortex. Some functions: attentional reorienting, representation updating and integration with sensory information.

- Premotor cortex / supplementary motor area (SMA). Some functions: action selection and motor planning.

Key subcortical regions are basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum

How do we know so much? Progress was/is made through lesion studies and functional neuroimaging.

# Evolutionary note: inter‑species differences in the mass of the PFC relative to the whole cerebral cortex

Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is disproportionately large, relative to total brain mass, in primates (and especially in humans).
  
Humans have especially massive dorsolateral and orbitofrontal regions. 

This may be the neural substrate to the greater executive function skills in humans compared with non-human primates and other mammels.

Function comes from structure. But structure is not just the mass of a region (this it not true: bigger = better). Structure involves also connectivity patterns (networks)

The first well documented case of selective lesion to the PFC.

[A railroad worker at the time.]{.fragment}
[In an accident, a metal rod passed through his skull.]{.fragment}
[He survived.]{.fragment} 
[But he became a different person.]{.fragment}

[_Before_ the accident:]{.fragment}
[responsible and smart.]{.fragment}

[_After_ the accident:]{.fragment}
[Able to walk and talk.]{.fragment}
[But unable to _control_ himself,]{.fragment}
[impatient, impulsive,]{.fragment}
[showing socially inappropriate behaviour,]{.fragment}
[and _no inhibition_.]{.fragment}

# Unity and diversity of executive functions: Miyake et al. (2000)

Seminal study evaluating quantitatively the commonalities and differences among several multiple executive-function tasks.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=60%}
[Key conclusions: executive function tasks show **unity** (shared variance among tasks) and **diversity** (distinct variance-based components among tasks).]{.fragment}
[Namely, there were three separable but moderately correlated factors:]{.fragment}

- Shifting (task‑set switching)
- Updating (working‑memory updating)
- Inhibition (suppressing prepotent responses)

# Beyond the core executive functions

The three core executive functions identified by Miyake et al. (2000) are important because they can be considered building blocks for higher-order functions, but they are _not exhaustive_.

Some additional processes commonly treated as executive functions include:

- Planning and problem solving

- Goal setting and maintenance

- Performance monitoring and error detection

- Cognitive flexibility beyond simple shifting (e.g., creativity)

- Decision‑making and value‑based control in some models
