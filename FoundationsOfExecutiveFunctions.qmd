:::

:::{.column}

Executive functions rely on a _distributed network_, involving several cortical and subcortical regions (i.e., nodes of the network) and their connections (i.e., edges of the network). 

[Traditionally, the **prefrontal cortex** (often shortened as PFC) is attributed a the role of an important node within this network.]{.fragment}

:::

::::



# What cortical regions are fundamental to executive funtcions? {.scrollable}

Key _cortical_ regions along with the main functions they enable:

| Region | Abbreviation | Key Functions |
|--------|------|---------------------------|
| Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex | DLPFC | Working memory, goal maintenance, planning and top‑down control |
| Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex | VLPFC | Response selection, inhibition, and controlled retrieval |
| Orbitofrontal cortex | OFC | Value representation, reward-guided decision making and impulse control |
| Anterior cingulate cortex* | ACC | Conflict monitoring, error detection, and performance adjustment |
| Parietal cortex | - | Attentional reorienting, representation updating and integration with sensory information |
| Premotor cortex / supplementary motor area | SMA | Action selection and motor planning |


*Note: anatomically it lies just outside the prefrontal cortex but it works in synergy with it

Key _subcortical_ regions are basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum

How do we know so much? Progress was/is made through lesion studies (real or virtual) and functional neuroimaging.

# Optional evolutionary note {.scrollable}

Inter‑species differences in the _mass_ of the PFC _relative_ to the whole cerebral cortex

:::

:::{.column width=40%}

Relative to total cortical mass, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is disproportionately large in primates (and especially in humans).

This may be the neural substrate to the greater executive function skills in primates compared with non-primates.

:::

:::{.column}

Frenology is a historical theory, now **discredited**, suggesting that the shape and size of the skull can determine a person's character and mental abilities.

Some key concepts:

- Localization of Function: Different areas of the brain are responsible for different traits and behaviors.
- Cranial Measurements: The bumps and indentations on the skull reflect the underlying brain structure.

:::
::::


[Despite getting the wrong answer, phrenology gets the credits for sparking important questions about the localization (in the brain) of cognitive functions.]{.fragment}

[Neuropsychology first and neuroscience later confirmed that each cortical region plays key roles in networks responsible for specific cognitive functions.]{.fragment}

[Earlier evidence for the connection between structure and function came from **lesion studies**: clinical assessment of patients with selective lesions to the cerebral cortex.]{.fragment}

# Unity and diversity of executive functions: Miyake et al. (2000) {.scrollable}

Seminal study evaluating quantitatively the commonalities and differences among several multiple executive-function tasks and the functions they represent.

[They used a variety of tasks to measure each of three functions, upon which there was growing consensus as being the _core executive functions_:]{.fragment}

:::


Two key conclusions: 

- the three core executive functions are _separable_: each explains a unique aspect of cognitive control.

- the three core executive functions are _correlated_: each contributes to explaining general aspects of cognitive control.

[This **unity and diversity** framework revolutionized how researchers conceptualize executive functions. Not as a single construct, but as three separable but moderately correlated functions.]{.fragment}


# Inhibition {.scrollable}

Inhibition refers to the ability to suppress dominant responses that are inappropriate or not relevant in a certain situation.

[How you might experience inhibition:]{.fragment}

- Resisting the urge to check your phone while studying
- Stopping yourself from eating a slice of cake when you are trying to eat healthy
- Not doing something that you normally do out of habit
- Not laughing during a serious or inappropriate moment


[Key properties of inhibition tasks:]{.fragment}

- You are presented with stimuli that contain two pieces of information (e.g., the word "high" spoken in either a high-pitched or low-pitched voice)
- Sometimes, the two pieces point at the same idea (_congruent trial_, e.g., the word "high" spoken in a high-pitched voice)
- Sometimes, the two pieces point at different ideas (_incongruent trial_, e.g., the word "low" spoken in a high-pitched voice)
- One of the two pieces is dominant; the one that is more automatic or habitual to process (e.g., the word meaning)
- Your task is to focus only on the non-dominant information.
- Congruent trials present no inhibitory challenge because the two pieces of information match.
- Incongruent trials require solving a _conflict_ between the to-be-inhibited dominant response and the required non-dominant response.


::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
:::{.fragment}
```{dot}
//| fig-width: 8
digraph {
    node [shape=plaintext]
    edge [arrowhead=none]
    rankdir=LR
    bgcolor="transparent"

    ST [label = "stimulus type"]
    C [label = "congruent"]
    I [label = "incongruent"]
    
    ST -> {C; I}
}
```
:::
:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
:::



[Key performance metric:]{.fragment}

- **Inhibition cost**: how slower and less accurate you become in incongruent vs congruent trials. In other words, the cost of solving the conflict by inhibiting the dominant information/response.


# Measuring inhibition through the **Stroop task** {.scrollable}

The Stroop task involves a conflict between the meaning of a word and the color of the ink it is printed in.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}

[Key features in a trial:]{.fragment}

- Stimulus: Words that represent colors printed in in/congruent colors (e.g., the word "red" printed in blue ink).
- Decision: Name the color of the ink, not the word itself.
- Response: Press the key corresponding to the color of the ink.

:::

:::{.column width=50%}

[Key outcome measures:]{.fragment}

- **Inhibition cost (response time)**: 
time taken to respond correctly to incongruent trials minus time taken to respond correctly to congruent trials.
- **Inhibition cost (accuracy)**: proportion of correctly responded incongruent trials minus proportion of correctly responded congruent trials.


:::
::::

[There are variations:]{.fragment}

- Different types of stimuli (e.g., shapes, numbers, visual/auditory modality).

# Measuring inhibition through the **Flanker task** {.scrollable}

The Flanker task involves resolving a conflict between a central target stimulus and surrounding flanking stimuli.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}

[Key features in a trial:]{.fragment}

- Stimulus: A central arrow (or letter) flanked by other arrows (or letters) that point in the same (congruent) or opposite (incongruent) direction.
- Decision: Identify the direction of the central arrow while ignoring the direction of the flanking stimuli.
- Response: Press the key corresponding to the direction of the central arrow.

:::

:::{.column width=50%}

[Key outcome measures:]{.fragment}

- **Inhibition cost (response time)**: 
time taken to respond correctly to incongruent trials minus time taken to respond correctly to congruent trials.
- **Inhibition cost (accuracy)**: proportion of correctly responded incongruent trials minus proportion of correctly responded congruent trials.

:::
::::

[There are variations:]{.fragment}

- Different types of stimuli (e.g., arrows, letters, fish).
- Different numbers of flankers (e.g., 2 vs 4 flanking stimuli).

# Updating {.scrollable}

Being able to maintain and manipulate information in working memory.

[How you might experience updating:]{.fragment}

- Mental arithmetic: keeping track of running totals while calculating (e.g., ,mentally adding up the cost of items in a shopping basket)

- Phone number exchanging: memorizing a phone number you have just been told, except they tell you "sorry, the third to last digit was 5"

- Navigation: remembering the sequence of turns you have taken to find your way back

[Key properties of updating tasks:]{.fragment}

- You are presented with a sequence of stimuli (e.g., letters, numbers, spatial positions)
- You must continuously maintain and update a mental representation of recent items
- The task requires you to discard old information and replace it with new information
- At some point, you must recall or recognize items from recent positions in the sequence

[Key performance metrics:]{.fragment}

- **Accuracy**: how correctly you can recall or recognize items at specified positions (e.g., an _n_-number of items back)
- **Response time**: how quickly you can respond when probed


# Measuring updating through the **n-back task** {.scrollable}

You see a continuous stream of stimuli (e.g., letters, digits, sounds, or locations). Each stimulus is presented for a short duration, and there might be a small gap until the next stimulus.

[Your task: for each stimulus, decide if the current item matches (i.e., is identical to) the one from _n_ steps earlier.]{.fragment} [A stimulus requiring a decision forms a trial.]{.fragment}

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}

[Common levels:]{.fragment}

- 1‑back (compare with the immediately previous item)
- 2‑back (compare with the item two steps back)
- 3‑back+ (increasing working‑memory load)
:::
:::{.column}
[Key features in a trial:]{.fragment}

- Stimulus appears briefly, then a short gap
- Decision: match vs non‑match with the item _n_ ago
- Response: one key for match, another for non‑match (or just one key for matching stimuli and withhold response for non-matching stimuli)

:::

[Stimulus modalities:]{.fragment}

- Visual symbols (letters/digits)
- spatial positions (spatial n‑back)
- tones (auditory), 
- a combination (dual n‑back)

[Key outcome measures:]{.fragment}

- Accuracy (number of correctly responded trials divided by the number of total trials)
- response times (time from the onset of the stimulus to the correct response within each trial)



[There are variations:]{.fragment}

- Dual n‑back (simultaneous auditory + visual streams)
- Adaptive n‑back (n increases/decreases based on performance)



# optional n-back task demonstration

[link to n-back task on psytoolkit](https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_nback2.html)



# Shifting/switching {.scrollable}

Being able to flexibly switch between tasks or rules.

[How you might experience shifting:]{.fragment}

- Language: switching language when translating to/from two languages

- Driving: shifting from following the navigation system to reacting to unexpected roadworks

- Home life: pausing cooking to answer the door

- Navigation on phone: switching from map view to messages and back

- Sports: switching from offense to defense 

[Key properties of switching task:]{.fragment}

- You are described two tasks, A and B. 
- For each task, you are given a set of stimuli that require a decision and then a response. Each set of stimuli requiring a decision/response is called a trial.
- Sometimes, you are asked to do task A, other times you are asked to do task B.
- In a block, you might be presented with only task A trials (_pure trials_). This is a pure block.
- In another block, you might be presented with some task A trials and some task B trials. This is a mixed block. In other words, some trials will require you to continue performing whichever task you were doing until then (_repeat trials_) or to switch to the other task (_switch trials_)

[Key performance metrics:]{.fragment}

- **Switch cost**: how slower and less accurate you are in switch trials vs repeat trials

- **Mixing cost**: how slower and less accurate you are in repeat trials vs pure trials

# Beyond the core executive functions

The three core executive functions studied by Miyake et al. (2000) are important because they can be considered building blocks for higher-order functions, but they are _not exhaustive_.

Some additional functions considered executive functions include:

- Planning and problem solving

- Goal setting and maintenance

- Performance monitoring and error detection

- Cognitive flexibility beyond simple shifting (e.g., creativity)

- Decision‑making and value‑based control in some models
