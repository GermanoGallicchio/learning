# Visuospatial attention


There are several theoretical models of visuospatial attention (but we will not go through each of them)

It is useful to think of attention as a spotlight moving in space

By definition, visuo-spatial attention is based on visual representations and most examples of spatial attention are _visuo_-spatial. But a similar concept can be applied to any other sensorial modalities.
:::


# Orienting

Selecting a certain location or object in space, so that processing of those stimuli is facilitated.

:::{.fragment}
Events occurring in that location (vs those occuring in another location):
:::

- are processed more quickly
- produce greater neural activity in related regions
- are detected at lower thresholds

:::{.fragment}
**Orienting** of visuospatial attention = aligning of attention with a source of sensory input or with an internal representation (memory)

# Covert or overt? Examples.

**Overt** orienting

<div style="font-size:0.8em">
- Turning your head or body toward a sound to better hear or identify it.
    *Example: You hear footsteps and turn your head to locate the source.*
</div>


**Covert** orienting
<div style="font-size:0.8em">
- Focusing attention on a particular sound or voice without moving your head or body.
    *Example: You listen for a specific person's voice in a crowded room while remaining still.*
- Tracking the location of people or objects based on auditory cues, without physically orienting toward them.
- You think about or track what someone is doing, even though you are looking somewhere else.
- You notice something happening at the edge of your perceptual field while not redirecting your senses towards it.
- You pay attention to something without moving your head or eyes.  
    *Example: You listen to a conversation behind you but keep facing forward.*

:::{.column width=80%}
The spatial cueing task is a experiment used to study how attention is directed in space. It helps us understand how **cues** can guide our focus, even without moving our eyes or head. [How does the task work?]{.fragment}

- You fix your gaze on a central point.
- A cue appears, indicating where a target might show up.
- After a brief _delay_, the target appears either at the cued location or elsewhere.
- You respond as quickly as possible when you detect the target.

[There is a catch: the cue does not always tell the truth.]{.fragment}

# Types of cues

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=33%}
**Valid cue**

- The cue correctly indicates where the target will appear.
- Example: A sound or light flashes on the left, and the target appears on the left.
- People respond faster to valid cues.

:::

:::{.column width=33%}
**Invalid cue**

- The cue points to the wrong location.
- Example: A cue flashes on the right, but the target appears on the left.
- Responses are slower because attention was misdirected.

:::

:::{.column width=33%}
**Neutral cue**

- The cue does not give information about the target's location.
- Example: A cue appears in the center or points in both directions.
- Response times are intermediate.

:::
::::


::: aside
:::{.fragment}
Extra knowledge: the delay between the cue and target is small. But varying it leads to an interesting phenomenon called "Inhibition of Return"
:::
:::

# Examples of possible non-visual adaptations

**Auditory version**

:::{.fragment}
Cue: a brief tone presented to either the left, right, of both ears

Target: another brief tone presented to either left or right ear

Task: Press a button as quickly as possible when you hear the target
:::


**Tactile version**

:::{.fragment}
Cue: a brief vibration presented to either the left, right, or both hands

Target: another brief vibration presented to either the left or right hand

Task: respond with your voice as soon quickly as possible when you feel the vibration

# Why this task is important in sport and exercise psychology

- It demonstrates how the focus of attention can be guided by cues (instructions), even without moving our senses [(is this covert or overt orienting?).]{.fragment}
- This helps us understand selective attention in everyday life and sports.
- It reveals that attention improves processing at the cued location and slows it elsewhere.
- It shows the **cost** of attending to the wrong location and the **benefit** of attending to the right location

**Two types of orienting:**

- exogenous
- endogenous
:::
:::

:::{.column}
**Exogenous** orienting: Associated with signals that capture attention automatically and involuntarily (like a sudden flash or sound). It is fast and reflexive.

**Endogenous** orienting: Associated with symbolic signals (like an arrow or instruction) that provide information about a location. Attention is then oriented voluntarily (intentionally).
:::
::::

In other words, there are two ways that attention can be shifted:

- **Endo**genous shift = "from inside", goal-directed, top-down (you control it)

- **Exo**genous shift = "from outside", stimulus driven, bottom-up (the environment controls it). Sometimes associated with a distracting stimulus.

|                | Exogenous cue | Endogenous cue |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|

# Posner studies (ca. 1970-80s)

Michael Posner used a **spatial cueing task** to investigate how attention is directed in space. Participants were asked to fixate on a central point while cues indicated where a target might appear. 

[The cues could be valid, invalid, or neutral. After a brief delay, the target appeared, and participants responded as quickly as possible. The study measured **response times** to the onset of the target.]{.fragment}

[The classic Posner study focused on **endogenous** (central, symbolic) cues such as arrows presented at the center.]{.fragment} [Exogenous cues (such as peripheral flashes) were introduced in later studies.]{.fragment}

[Participants were required to keep their eyes on the fixation cross the whole time.]{.fragment}

---

The classic design typically used **80% valid**, **20% invalid**, and **50% neutral** trials as a separate baseline.

:::{.fragment}
::: {.callout-note}
The percentages refer to the distribution of **trial types** within the experiment, not to a single set of trials. Typically, the experiment is structured so that, for example, 80% of the *cued* trials are valid and 20% are invalid, while *neutral* trials are presented as a separate baseline (often making up 50% of the total trials, or sometimes 1/3 if all three types are equally represented). The numbers in the example above are illustrative and not meant to sum to 100% in a single block—they describe the proportions within each trial type.
:::
:::


::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
| trial type |  function  |
|---|---|
| neutral | serve as a control condition for the other two |
| valid | study the **benefits** of attending to the correct location |
| invalid | study the **costs** of attending to the wrong location |
:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
- **Neutral trials**: serve as a control condition for the other two
- **Valid trials**: study the benefits of attending to the correct location

Questions:

**Why did Posner decide to make the cue 80% of the times valid? Why not 100%?​**

[If it were 100%, then the cue would never be invalid, and Posner could not study the cost of attending to an incorrect location]{.fragment}


**Why then 80-20% and not 50-50%?​**

[To build trustworthiness in the cue: the participant oriented their attention to the cued direction because _most of the times_ the cue pointed in the correct direction​. If the participant learned over time that the cue was uninformative, they would stop using]{.fragment}

**Were participants supposed to orient their attention overtly or covertly?**

[Covertly. In fact, they were required to keep their eyes on the central fixation cross.]{.fragment}


# Posner task: basic results


```{r}
# Data
conditions <- c("Invalid 20%", "Neutral 50%", "Valid 80%")
response_times <- c(300, 260, 230)

# Base R barplot
barplot(
  height = response_times,
  names.arg = conditions,
  col = c("red", "gray", "green"),
  ylim = c(230, 310),
  xlab = "Condition",
  ylab = "Response Time [ms]"
)

```

<div style="font-size: 0.8em">

Key result:

- Response times were slowest for invalid trials (i.e., target preceded by an invalid cue), faster for neutral trials (i.e., target preceded by a neutral, uninformative cue), and fastest for valid trials (i.e., target preceded by a valid cue)

Key interpretation:

- Valid cue pre-activates a an attentional path which is the same as that activated by the target

- Invalid cue pre-activates a an attentional path which is different from that activated by the target

</div>


# We just scratched the surfaced of the spatial cueing literature

Most later studies are more complex than this.​

[One (of many) idea: a valid cue does not always
cause facilitation...​]{.fragment}

[How can it be? Any ideas?]{.fragment}

[If the cue is exogenous and the cue-target delay
is longer than expected, the target is detected
more slowly]{.fragment}​

[This phenomenon is known as _inhibition of return​_ (however, this is not topic for this module)]{.fragment}
