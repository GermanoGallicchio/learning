The **soma**, or cell body, contains the nucleus and is responsible for maintaining the cell's health and metabolic functions.

**Neurites** are projections from the soma and include both dendrites and the axon.

**Dendrites** are branched extensions that receive signals from other neurons and transmit them toward the soma.

The **axon** is a long, singular projection that transmits signals away from the soma to other neurons, muscles, or glands.

    alt="Neuron Cell Body",
    width="100%"
/>
]

.right-column[
The soma, also known as the cell body, is the central part of a neuron. It contains the **nucleus**, which houses the cell's genetic material, and is responsible for **regulating** the neuron's activities, including protein synthesis and energy production. The soma **integrates** incoming signals from the dendrites and determines whether to generate an action potential that travels down the axon.
]

# Dendrites

    alt="Dendrites",
    width="80%"
/>
]

.right-column[
Dendrites are specialized structures that **receive "information"** from other neurons (axons). Each neuron typically has **many dendrites**, which are organized in a branching pattern known as the **dendritic tree**. The **structure and shape** of dendrites vary across different types of neurons, enabling diverse functional roles in neural communication.
]

# Axon

.left-column[
<img 
    src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Anatomy_of_neuron.png",
    alt="Axon",
    width="80%"
/>
]

.right-column[
The **axon** is a singular, elongated projection that **transmits "information"** away from the soma to other neurons, muscles, or glands. While each neuron has **only one axon**, it may branch into **collaterals** to communicate with multiple targets. Many axons are **wrapped in myelin**, a fatty substance that **speeds up** signal transmission by enabling faster conduction of electrical impulses.
]

# Electrochemical Communication

.left-column[

    alt="Electrochemical Communication",
    width="80%"
/>
]

.right-column[
When stimulated, **dendrites** change their chemicals, generating an electrical **post-synaptic potential**. This potential is conducted **passively** towards the soma and then to the **axon hillock**.

The potentials generated by many dendrites are **summed** (some positive, some negative). If the resulting potential is **large enough**, it triggers an **action potential** in the axon.

The **action potential** is a rapid change in electrical potential that propagates along the axon and reaches the **synapse**, enabling communication with other neurons.
]

---

# Action Potential

.left-column[
<img 
    src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Figure_35_02_04.png",
    alt="Action Potential",
    width="80%"
/>
]

.right-column[
An **action potential** is a rapid and temporary change in the electrical potential across a neuron's membrane. It is the primary mechanism by which neurons transmit signals over long distances.

The process involves several key steps:
1. **Resting State**: The neuron is at rest, with a negative charge inside the cell relative to the outside.
2. **Depolarization**: When a stimulus reaches the neuron, sodium channels open, allowing **Na⁺ ions** to flow into the cell, making the inside more positive.
3. **Repolarization**: Potassium channels open, allowing **K⁺ ions** to flow out of the cell, restoring the negative charge inside.
4. **Hyperpolarization**: The membrane potential temporarily becomes more negative than the resting state before stabilizing.

This electrical signal propagates along the axon to the synapse, where it triggers the release of neurotransmitters, enabling communication with other neurons.

# Synapse

Pronounced _ˈsɪn.æps_

.left-column[
<img 
    src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/1225_Chemical_Synapse.jpg",
    alt="Synapse",
    width="80%"
/>
]

.right-column[
The **synapse** is the junction between the **axon terminal** of one neuron and the **dendrite** or soma of another neuron. It is the site where **neurotransmitters** are released to facilitate communication between neurons.

When an **action potential** reaches the axon terminal, it triggers the release of **chemical messengers** (neurotransmitters) into the **synaptic cleft**. These chemicals bind to **receptors** on the post-synaptic neuron, causing changes in its electrical state.

Synapses can be **excitatory** or **inhibitory**, depending on the type of neurotransmitter and receptor involved. This process is essential for all forms of **neural communication**, including learning, memory, and reflexes.
]

# Synaptic communication

.left-column[
<img 
    src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/1225_Chemical_Synapse.jpg",
    alt="Synaptic Communication",
    width="80%"
/>
]

.right-column[
In synaptic communication, the **presynaptic neuron** (sender) releases **neurotransmitters** from its axon terminal into the **synaptic cleft**. These chemical messengers travel across the cleft and bind to **receptors** on the **postsynaptic neuron** (receiver).

The **presynaptic neuron** is responsible for generating and transmitting the signal, while the **postsynaptic neuron** receives and processes the signal. This interaction can either **excite** or **inhibit** the postsynaptic neuron, depending on the type of neurotransmitter and receptor involved.

This precise and regulated process ensures effective communication between neurons, which is critical for brain function and behavior.
]

# Neurotransmitter


.left-column[
<img 
    src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/SynapseSchematic_en.svg",
    alt="Synapse Schematic",
    width="80%"
/>
]

.right-column[
    Neurotransmitters are **chemical messengers** that play a crucial role in synaptic communication. They are released by the **presynaptic neuron** into the **synaptic cleft** in response to an action potential. Once released, neurotransmitters bind to specific **receptors** on the **postsynaptic neuron**, triggering changes in its electrical or chemical state.


]

Different neurotransmitters have distinct effects:
- **Excitatory neurotransmitters** (e.g., glutamate) increase the likelihood of the postsynaptic neuron firing an action potential.
- **Inhibitory neurotransmitters** (e.g., GABA) decrease the likelihood of the postsynaptic neuron firing.

This process ensures precise and regulated communication between neurons, enabling complex processes such as learning, memory, and motor control.

# Types of Neurons

Neurons can be classified based on several characteristics, including:
- number of dendrites
- shape of dendrites
- axon length
- type of neurotransmitter they release

This classification highlights the _diversity_ of neurons and their _specialized_ roles in the nervous system.

# Classification by Neurotransmitter

.small-text[
Neurotransmitters play diverse roles in neural communication. Some neurotransmitters are **excitatory**, meaning they activate the postsynaptic neuron and increase the likelihood of an action potential. Others are **inhibitory**, suppressing the activity of the postsynaptic neuron and reducing the likelihood of an action potential. Additionally, some neurotransmitters are **modulatory**, influencing the overall activity of neural circuits by altering the strength or dynamics of synaptic communication.

| **Type**       | **Description**                                                                 | **Examples**                     |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Excitatory     | Release neurotransmitters that increase the likelihood of action potentials in the postsynaptic neuron. | Glutamatergic neurons            |
| Inhibitory     | Release neurotransmitters that decrease the likelihood of action potentials in the postsynaptic neuron. | GABAergic neurons                |
| Modulatory     | Release neurotransmitters that modulate the activity of other neurons.          | Dopaminergic, serotonergic neurons |

# Spiking Rate and Neural Coding

How do neurons code different information?

While the amplitude of an action potential remains constant, the frequency at which these signals are generated can vary. This variation in the **spiking rate** is a key mechanism for encoding information.

.small-text[
- The amplitude of an action potential _does not vary_, but the **number** of action potentials propagated **per second** varies along a continuum.
- This rate of responding (also called the **spiking rate**) relates to the informational code carried by that neuron.
- The context in which a neuron shows **high spiking rate** is very specific and provides insights into its functional role. For example, a neuron may exhibit a high spiking rate during specific activities, such as processing auditory information during speech, indicating its **specialization** in that domain.
- Neurons that respond to similar types of information are often spatially **grouped together**, reflecting **regional functional specialisation**.

# Not just neurons

.small-text[
Glial cells, or **glia** (pronounced _ˈɡliː.ə_ or _ˈɡlaɪ.ə_), are _non-neuronal_ cells in the nervous system that provide support, protection, and nourishment to neurons. They play a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis of the neural environment and facilitating efficient neural communication.

# Types of glia

.small-text[

Brief overview

| **Type**         | **Function**                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Astrocytes       | Maintain the blood-brain barrier, regulate nutrient supply, and support synaptic function. |
| Oligodendrocytes | Produce myelin sheaths that insulate axons in the CNS, enabling faster signal transmission. |
| Schwann Cells    | Produce myelin sheaths in the peripheral nervous system (PNS).              |
| Microglia        | Act as immune cells in the CNS, removing debris and protecting against pathogens. |
| Ependymal Cells  | Line the ventricles of the brain and produce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).     |


Glial cells are essential for the overall health and functionality of the nervous system, working in tandem with neurons to ensure efficient communication and adaptability.

# Neurons and glia


Until recently, it was believed that the **ratio of neurons to glial cells** in the human brain was approximately **1:10**, meaning there were ten times as many glial cells as neurons. However, recent research has revised this estimate, suggesting a ratio closer to **1:1**.

This ratio is not uniform across the nervous system; different regions exhibit varying proportions of neurons and glial cells. For example:
- The **cerebral cortex** has a higher density of neurons relative to glial cells.
- The **white matter** contains more glial cells due to the abundance of myelinated axons.

.right-column[
.small-text[
The cerebral cortex is divided into distinct zones based on differences in cytoarchitecture. These zones, known as **Brodmann areas**, identified in the early 20th century by Korbinian Brodmann. 

Generally, each area is associated with specific functions, such as sensory processing, motor control, or higher cognitive tasks.

For example:
- **Primary motor cortex (Brodmann area 4)**: Contains large pyramidal neurons critical for voluntary _movement_.
- **Broca's area (Brodmann areas 44 and 45)**: Located in the frontal lobe, it is critical for speech _production_ and language processing.
]
