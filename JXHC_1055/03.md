.right-column[
The **soma**, or cell body, is the central part of a neuron that contains the _nucleus_, which houses the cell's genetic material (DNA). The soma is responsible for maintaining the neuron's health, regulating its metabolic functions, and synthesizing proteins necessary for the neuron's structure and signaling processes.
]

---
template: neuron

.right-column[
**Neurites** are projections from the soma and include both dendrites and the axon.

**Dendrites** are branched extensions that receive signals from other neurons and transmit them toward the soma.

The **axon** is a long, singular projection that transmits signals away from the soma to other neurons, muscles, or glands.

]

.right-column[
Dendrites are specialized structures that **receive information*** from other neurons (axons). 

Each neuron typically has **many dendrites**, which are organized in a branching pattern known as the **dendritic tree**. 


The **structure and shape** of dendrites vary across different types of neurons, enabling diverse functional roles in neural communication.

]

# Axon

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img

    alt="Electrochemical Communication",
    width="60%"
/>
</div>

The **axon** is a singular, elongated projection that **transmits information** away from the soma to other neurons (dendrites or soma). 

--

While each neuron has **only one axon**, it may branch into **collaterals** to communicate with multiple targets. 

--

.small-text[
Many axons are **wrapped in myelin**, a fatty substance that **speeds up** signal transmission by enabling faster conduction of electrical impulses.
]

# Soma

<div style="text-align: center;">

    alt="Neuron Cell Body",
    width="60%"
/>
</div>


The soma, also known as the cell body, is the central part of a neuron. 
--
It contains the nucleus, which houses the cell's genetic material, 
--
and is responsible for regulating the neuron's activities, including protein synthesis and energy production. 
--
The soma **integrates** incoming signals from the dendrites and determines whether to generate an action potential that travels down the axon.

---

# Electrochemical Communication: post-synaptic potential

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img 
    src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Anatomy_of_neuron.png",
    alt="Axon",
    width="50%"
/>
</div>

When stimulated, the **dendrites** change their chemicals, generating an electrical **post-synaptic potential**. 

--

This potential is conducted **passively** towards the soma and then to the **axon hillock**.

--

The potentials generated by many dendrites are **summed** (some positive, some negative). If the resulting potential is **large enough**, it triggers an **action potential** in the axon.

---

# Electrochemical Communication: Action Potential


<div style="text-align: center">
<img

    alt="Image of a neuron with its axon in foreground",
    width="100%"
>
</div>

The **action potential** is a rapid change in electrical potential that propagates along the axon 
--
and reaches the **synapse**, the interface (or junction) with another neuron.

---
name: synapse

# Synapse (Pronounced _ˈsɪn.æps_)

<div style="text-align: right">

]
</div>

--

.right-column[

The synapse is the junction between the **axon terminal** of one neuron and the **dendrite** (or soma) of another neuron. 

When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, it triggers the release of **neurotransmitters** into the **synaptic cleft**. 

These chemicals bind to receptors on the post-synaptic neuron, causing changes in its electrical state.

]

---
template: synapse

.right-column[
It is the site where **neurotransmitters** are released to allow communication between neurons.

Synapses can be **excitatory** or **inhibitory**, depending on the type of neurotransmitter and receptor involved. This process is essential for all forms of **neural communication**, including learning, memory, and reflexes.
]

---
template: synapse


.right-column[

The **presynaptic neuron** (sender) releases **neurotransmitters** from its axon terminal into the synaptic cleft, whereas the **postsynaptic neuron** receives and processes the signal. 

This interaction can either **excite** or **inhibit** the postsynaptic neuron, depending on the type of neurotransmitter and receptor involved.

The summation of multiple post-synaptic potentials will determine whether that neuron will, in turn, generate its own action potential.

.right-column[
Neurotransmitters are molecules that play a crucial role in synaptic communication. They are released by the **presynaptic neuron** into the synaptic cleft in response to an action potential. 

]

--

Once released, neurotransmitters bind to specific receptors on the **postsynaptic neuron**, triggering changes in its electrical or chemical state.

.left-column[
**Excitatory neurotransmitters** (e.g., glutamate) increase the likelihood of the postsynaptic neuron firing an action potential.
**Inhibitory neurotransmitters** (e.g., GABA) decrease the likelihood of the postsynaptic neuron firing.
**Modulatory neurotransmitters** adjust properties (e.g., excitability) of neural circuits.
]

--

The **interplay** between inhibition and excitation ensures precise and regulated communication among neurons, enabling complex processes such as learning, memory, and motor control.

# Types of Neurons

Neurons can be classified based on several characteristics, including:

--

- number of dendrites

--

- shape of dendrites

--

- axon length

--

- type of neurotransmitter they release

--

This classification highlights the _diversity_ of neurons and their _specialized_ roles in the nervous system.

--

.right-column[
Golgi **Type II** neurons, also known as **local circuit neurons**, have short axons that remain close to the soma, facilitating communication within a localized area.
]

# Classification by Neurotransmitter


In addition to **excitatory** (i.e., they activate the postsynaptic neuron and increase the likelihood of an action potential) 
--
and **inhibitory** (i.e., they suppress the activity of the postsynaptic neuron and reducing the likelihood of an action potential), 
--
some neurotransmitters are **modulatory**: they influence the overall activity of neural circuits by altering the strength or dynamics of synaptic communication.

--

For example, a modulatory neurotransmitter can influence the excitability of a postsynaptic neuron.

# Dual Nature of Neural Information Communication

Dendrites receives information. 
--
The soma receives and integrates information. 
--
The axon sends information. 

--

But what information are we talking about? 
--
**Electrico-chemical potentials**

--

.left-column[
<div class="mermaid">
graph LR
    A[Neural Communication]
    A --> B[Electrical Communication 
    Within Neuron]
    A --> C[Chemical Communication
    Between Neurons]
</div>
]

--

.right-column[
Neurons communicate information using both **electrical** and **chemical** mechanisms.
]

--

Within a neuron, information is transmitted _electrically_ (post-synaptic potentials, action potential).

Between neurons (in the synaps), information is transmitted _chemically_ via neurotransmitters.

---

# Spiking Rate and Neural Coding

The action potential is always the same: same voltage and same duration. 
--
It is "all or nothing": either sent or not sent.
--
So how do neurons communication different information?

--

Through **spiking rate**: the _number_ of action potentials sent _per second_. The frequency at which action potentials are sent (i.e., how often they are sent) can vary. 
--
The **spiking rate** encodes meaning in neuronal communication.

--

For example, a neuron may exhibit a high spiking rate during specific activities, such as processing auditory information during speech, indicating its **specialization** in that domain.

--

Neurons that respond to similar types of information are often spatially **grouped together**, reflecting **regional functional specialization**.

.right-column[

Glial cells, or **glia** (pronounced _ˈɡliː.ə_), are _non-neuronal_ cells in the nervous system that provide support, protection, and nourishment to neurons. They play a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis of the neural environment and facilitating efficient neural communication.

This illustration shows **different types of glial cells** and their roles.

# Types of glia


Brief overview of some glial cells

| **Type**         | **Function**                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Astrocytes       | Maintain the blood-brain barrier, regulate nutrient supply, and support synaptic function. |
| Oligodendrocytes | Produce myelin sheaths that insulate axons in the CNS, enabling faster signal transmission. |
| Schwann Cells    | Produce myelin sheaths in the peripheral nervous system (PNS)              |
| Microglia        | Act as immune cells in the CNS, clearing damaged cells and protecting against pathogens |

# Neurons and glia


Until recently, it was believed that the **ratio of neurons to glial cells** in the human brain was approximately **1:10**, meaning there were ten times as many glial cells as neurons. However, recent research has revised this estimate, suggesting a ratio closer to **1:1**.

--

This ratio is not uniform across the nervous system; different regions exhibit varying proportions of neurons and glial cells. For example:
- The **cerebral cortex** has a higher density of neurons relative to glial cells.
- The **white matter** contains more glial cells due to the abundance of myelinated axons.

---

# White and gray matter

]

.right-column[
The brain is composed of **gray matter** and **white matter**, each playing distinct roles in neural function.

- **Gray matter** consists primarily of **neuronal cell bodies**, **dendrites**, and **glial cells**. It is involved in processing and integrating information.
- **White matter** is made up of **myelinated axons**, which facilitate the rapid transmission of signals between different brain regions.
