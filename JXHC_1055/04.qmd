>Everyone knows what attention is. It is the [taking possession by the mind]{.fragment .highlight-red fragment-index=1}, in clear and vivid form, of [one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought]{.fragment .highlight-red fragment-index=2}. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. [It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others]{.fragment .highlight-red fragment-index=3}, and is a condition which has a real opposite in the confused, dazed, scatterbrain state.
:::
::::


[point 1: We can choose the focus of attention. Attention can be voluntary.]{.fragment fragment-index=1}

[point 2: Inability to attend to many things at once]{.fragment fragment-index=2}

[point 3: Limited capacity to process information. 
Attention is a selective process]{.fragment fragment-index=3}

# Visuospatial attention


There are several theoretical models of visuospatial attention (but we will not go through each of them)

It is useful to think of attention as a spotlight moving in space

Selecting a certain location or object in space, so that processing of those stimuli is facilitated.
:::

:::{.fragment}
Events occurring in that location (vs those occuring in another location):
:::

- are processed more quickly
- produce greater neural activity in related regions
- are detected at lower thresholds

:::{.fragment}
**Orienting** of visuospatial attention = aligning of attention with a source of sensory input or with an internal representation (memory)

**covert orienting**: attention is directed in space independently of the sensorial organs (e.g., direction of eyes or head)
:::

:::{.fragment}
**overt orienting**: Directing the sensorial organs
towards the region of space of interest.

# Covert or overt?

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
Overt orienting

- Turning your head or body toward a sound to better hear or identify it.
    *Example: You hear footsteps and turn your head to locate the source.*
- You pay attention to something without moving your head or eyes.  
    *Example: You listen to a conversation behind you but keep facing forward.*

:::

:::{.column width=50%}
Covert orienting

- Focusing attention on a particular sound or voice without moving your head or body.
    *Example: You listen for a specific person's voice in a crowded room while remaining still.*
- Tracking the location of people or objects based on auditory cues, without physically orienting toward them.
- You think about or track what someone is doing, even though you are looking somewhere else.
- You notice something happening at the edge of your perceptual field while not redirecting your senses towards it.

The spatial cueing task is a experiment used to study how attention is directed in space. It helps us understand how **cues** can guide our focus, even without moving our eyes or head. [How does the task work?]{.fragment}

- You fix your gaze on a central point.
- A cue appears, indicating where a target might show up.
- After a brief delay, the target appears either at the cued location or elsewhere.
- You respond as quickly as possible when you detect the target.

[There is a catch: the cue does not always tell the truth.]{.fragment}

[Michael Posner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Posner_(psychologist)) is an American cognitive psychologist known for his pioneering research on attention and the development of the spatial cueing task.

# Types of cues

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=33%}
**Valid cue**

- The cue correctly indicates where the target will appear.
- Example: A sound or light flashes on the left, and the target appears on the left.
- People respond faster to valid cues.

:::

:::{.column width=33%}
**Invalid cue**

- The cue points to the wrong location.
- Example: A cue flashes on the right, but the target appears on the left.
- Responses are slower because attention was misdirected.

:::

:::{.column width=33%}
**Neutral cue**

- The cue does not give information about the target's location.
- Example: A cue appears in the center or points in both directions.
- Response times are intermediate.

# Examples of possible non-visual adaptations

**Auditory version**

:::{.fragment}
Cue: a brief tone presented to either the left, right, of both ears

Target: another brief tone presented to either left or right ear

Task: Press a button as quickly as possible when you hear the target
:::


**Tactile version**

:::{.fragment}
Cue: a brief vibration presented to either the left, right, or both hands

Target: another brief vibration presented to either the left or right hand

Task: respond with your voice as soon quickly as possible when you feel the vibration
:::

::: aside
Cue-Target Delay: The delay between the cue and target is small
:::


# Why this task has been so influencial

- It demonstrates how the attention can be guided by cues, even without moving our senses.
- It reveals that attention improves processing at the cued location and slows it elsewhere.
- This helps us understand selective attention in everyday life and sports.
- It shows the **cost** of attenting to the wrong location and the **benefit** of attenting to the right location

conditions <- c("Invalid 20%", "Neutral 50%", "Valid 80%")
