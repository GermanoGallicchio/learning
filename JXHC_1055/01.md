- **study** of people's behavior, thoughts, and feelings in sport and exercise contexts

The ABC of Psychology

| Affect (Feelings) | Behavior (Actions) | Cognition (Thoughts) |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Emotions, moods   | Performance, habits| Beliefs, attitudes    |
| Stress, anxiety    | Communication      | Decision-making       |
| Motivation         | Leadership         | Problem-solving       |

# Discipline location in relation with Sport Science and Psychology

Sport and exercise psychology lives in the _intersection_ of sport and exercise science and psychology

# Objective: Sport psychology

Understand the effects of psychological factors on physical or 
motor performance
Examples:

accuracy?

---

# Objective B

Objective B: Exercise Psychology

development, health, and well-being
Examples:

sports?

---

# Role of sport and exercise psychologists

#### Research

Goal: Advance knowledge in the field

Where: University or Research Institute

#### Teaching

Goal: Educate future sport and exercise psychologists

Where: usually in a University

#### Consulting

Goal: depending on the client (e.g., well-being, performance)

Where: Athletic teams, military, fitness industry

---

# Two specialties

#### Clinical sport and exercise psychologists
- Identify and treat individuals with emotional disorders (e.g., 
anxiety, depression, eating disorders)
- Require clinical license on top of sport and exercise 
psychology training

#### Educational sport and exercise specialists
- Not licensed for clinical psychologists
- Extensive training in kinesiology 
- Provide “mental coaching” through psychological skills

---

# Three orientations

#### Social-Psychological

Study of how individuals are influenced by the social environment 
and vice versa

--

#### Psychophysiological

Physiological activity (e.g., brain waves, heart rate) as markers of 
psychological states (e.g., concentration, attention)

--

#### Cognitive-behavioural

Mental processes (e.g., memory, attention, language, perception) driving observable behaviour (e.g., performance, decisions)

---

# Attention

To watch in your own time.

Videos 1 and 2 about selective attention. Video 3 on an elite sport application.

# Brief historocal overview of sport and exercise psychology

<div class="mermaid">
 timeline
    title development of sport and exercise psychology
    1890-1920s : Early years
    1920-40s : First laboratory testing
    1940-60s : Preparation for the future
    1960-80s : Academic discipline
    1980-90s : Multidisciplinary science and practice
    2000-present : Contemporary sport and exercise psychology
</div>

---

# Early years

1890-1920s
Philosophical perspective
Experimental perspective
E.g., Why do cyclists ride faster when 
racing in groups than individually?


---

# First laboratory testing

1920-40s
Development of laboratories in 
various western countries
Testing athletes on reaction times, 
concentration, aggression, etc

---

# Preparation for the future

1940-60s
University professors teaching 
sport and exercise psychology
First consultants hired by 
professional athletic teams

---

# Academic discipline

1960-80s
Kinesiology (sport and exercise 
science) becomes a discipline 
Sport and exercise psychology as 
part of kinesiology

---

# Multidisciplinary science and practice

1980-90s
Sport and exercise psychology 
becomes a separate discipline
Specialty scientific societies and 
journals

---

# Contemporary sport and exercise psychology

2000-present
Exponential growth
Esteemed academic discipline
Recognised practical importance
Driving knowledge in other fields

---

# Review questions

Discuss in small groups

1. Think of **examples** of sport and exercise psychology science or practice that you have come across.

2. What is sport and exercise psychology? What are its two **objectives**?

3. Describe the three main **roles** of sport and exercise psychology specialists

---

# Science vs practice

    <circle cx="40%" cy="50%" r="20%" fill="purple" fill-opacity="0.5"/>
    <circle cx="60%" cy="50%" r="20%" fill="orange" fill-opacity="0.5"/>
    <text x="35%" y="50%" text-anchor="middle" fill="black" font-size="1em">Science</text>
    <text x="65%" y="50%" text-anchor="middle" fill="black" font-size="1em">Practice</text>
</svg>

Sport and exercise psychology as a **scientific** discipline

#### Tenets of the scientific method:
Systematic approach to studying a question
Control of conditions
Empirical (based on observations)
Objective evidence and not opinions
Critical analysis of measurements and ideas

---

# Science vs practice

A major objective of the application of the scientific method is the development of a **theory**

#### What is a theory?

Not a speculative guess...
...but a set of interrelated facts on a certain 
phenomenon
Describes the **what** of a certain phenomenon
Explains the **how** and **why** of its mechanisms
Supported by **empirical evidence**
Makes **testable predictions**

---

# Science vs practice

Sport and exercise psychology as a **practice** discipline

Guided by trial-and-error learning
Based on systematic observation, personal experience, 
introspection, intuition, …and scientific method
Compared to scientific knowledge:
More holistic (global)
Quicker to implement novel ideas
Produces fewer or no explanations
Affected by bias and less reliable

---

# Critical reflections

You are interested in studying the effects of two strategies of penalty taking in football/soccer.

**Strategy A.** Pick a target and ignore any goal-keeper’s movements

**Strategy B.** Observe the goal-keeper movements during the run-up and then decide where to place the ball

#### How would you design an experimental study to test which strategy leads to better performance outcome?

Think about participants, Instructions, Measurements, Groups/Conditions, Analysis
