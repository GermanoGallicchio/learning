# Questionnaire activity (part 1)

Fill in the questionnare "Task and Ego orientation in Sport Questionnaire" (Duda, 1989). There is no right or wrong.

We will compute the scores (page 2) later in the session



# Intuitive understanding

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Etymology (origin of the word) of _motivation_: from the Lating "motus" meaning "motion"

A working definition for now can be "what moves somebody"

Analogy of "stick and carrot"

# Cognitive Evaluation Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1991)

The way in which rewards are _interpreted_ (appraisal) has an impact on motivation

<!--

The same reward can be interpreted as
- _controlling_ (i.e., trying to influence their behaviour), resulting in decreased intrinsic motivation
- _informational_ (i.e., providing constructive feedback), resulting in enhanced intrinsic motivation

.small-text[
Examples:
- Coach: “Win and we skip tomorrow’s session” (controlling) vs “Your tackle timing improved; keep that footwork” (informational)
- Prize for just showing up (controlling) vs a progress report with specific, constructive comments (informational)

# Intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation

|    | **Intrinsic** | **Extrinsic** |
|---:|---------------|---------------|
| purpose: activity...  | ...undertaken for its own pleasures | ...undertaken for instrumental benefits |
| reward: | experience itself | social or objective rewards (e.g., trophies, praise) |
| competitive pressure: | less pressure (concerned with the experience) | more pressure (concerned with the benefits) |

--

.small-text[
- Intrinsic: running because you enjoy the sensation and challenge
- Extrinsic: running to qualify for team selection, or to earn a bonus

# Which one is better?

Intrinsic is often the ideal type

--

Theoretically distinct...

--

...but practically interacting in real life: more of one is associated with less of the other

# Anectode of the old man and the kids

.right-column-66[
.small-text[
An old man lived alone on a street where boys played noisily every afternoon. The din annoyed him, so one day he called the boys to his door. He told them he loved the cheerful sound of children’s voices and promised them each 50 cents if they would return the next day. Next afternoon the youngsters raced back and played more lustily than ever. The old man paid them and promised another reward the next day. Again they returned, whooping it up, and the man again paid them; this time 25 cents. The following day they got only 15 cents, and the man explained that his meager resources were being exhausted. “Please, though, would you come to play for 10 cents tomorrow?” The disappointed boys told the man they would not be back. It wasn’t worth the effort, they said, to play all afternoon at his house for only 10 cents.

# Over time, external rewards can turn intrinsic motivation to extrinsic motivation

# One can turn into the other

</div>


Further examples:
- A toddler's drawing activity becomes less enjoyable when rewards are introduced, as the focus shifts from the joy of drawing to earning the reward.
- Volunteering becomes less enjoyable when it transitions to a paid activity, as the focus shifts from intrinsic satisfaction to the external reward.
- Removing external rewards, such as points or badges, can renew interest in an activity when the activity itself is inherently enjoyable.

# Hierarchical Model of Intrinsic/Extrinsic Motivation (HMIEM, Lalande & Vallerand, 2014)

Three hierarchical levels (from most specific to most general):
- situational (most specific)
- contextual
- global (most general)

--

.left-column[
**Similarity across levels**. For example, high intrinsic motivation at the global level is associated with high intrinsic motivation at the contextual level

| level | example
| ----- | ------ |
| situational | specific drills, specific parts of the game |
| contextual | football |

# Achievement Goal Theory (Nichols, 1984)

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img 
        src="https://kroki.io/mermaid/svg/eNpLy8kvT85ILCpR8AniUgAC_2j_oszUvJLEksz8vOJYsJhjdEhicbYCkgRE3CnaNT0fU9hfQVfXTsERie3EBQDFZh4V",
        width="40%",
        alt="Diagram generated by Kroki"
/>
</div>

--

Two orientations (also known as "achievement goals"):
- **Task** / mastery orientation: focus on aquiring competence and personal development
- **Ego** / performance/outcome orientation: focus on demonstrating better performance than others

.small-text[
Examples:
- Task: “Try to beat your own best lap time today”
- Ego: “Finish ahead of your teammate today”
]

---
template: agt

--

The two orientations are associated with different behaviours and thoughts

| Orientation | Persistence (in spite of failure) | Moral behaviour | Perceived competence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task | high | high | stable |
| Ego  | low  | low  | unstable* |

.footnote[
*contingent on comparisons with others

# Achievement Goal Theory (Nichols, 1984)

Two climates (also known as "perceived demands"):

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img 
        src="https://kroki.io/mermaid/svg/eNpLy8kvT85ILCpR8AniUgAC52jnnMzcxJLU4lgw3zE6JLE4W8G_KDM1rySxJDM_DyLuFO2ano8p7Kygq2un4IjEduICABPiHCQ=",
        width="40%",
        alt="Diagram generated by Kroki"
/>
</div>

--

Climates are environments that facilitates or impede the development of a certain personal orientation.

- **Task** climate: rewards and punishments are contingent to development and effort
- **Ego** climate: rewards and punishments are contingent to distance from desired outcome

---
template: agt2

Typically, an ego climate fosters ego orientation, and a task climate fosters task orientation.*

.footnote[*But it's possible to have a task orientation within an ego climate.]

# Approach vs motivation

Distinction used across several motivation models:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img 
        src="https://kroki.io/mermaid/svg/eNpLy8kvT85ILCpR8AniUgACl2iXzKLU5JLM_LxYsIBjtGNBQVF-YnIGhO8U7ViWn5mSmJecChFwUdDVtVNwRGI7AQBiuxc-",
        width="40%",
        alt="Diagram generated by Kroki"
/>
</div>

--

**Approach** motivation refers to the tendency to move _towards_ a desired goal, reward, or positive outcome.  
.small-text[Example: Aim to learn a new skill this week]

**Avoidance** motivation refers to the tendency to move _away from_ an undesired situation, threat, or negative outcome.  
.small-text[Example: Aim to avoid making mistakes this week]

# Trichotomous model (Elliot, 1999)

The trichotomous model expands on previous theories by integrating three dimensions of motivation to provide a more detailed understanding of achievement-related behaviors.

Three dimensions: **Orientation** / achievement goal (task, ego), **Climate** / perceived demands (task, ego), **Direction** (approach, avoidance)

# "Two-by-two model" (Elliot, 1999)


|          | **Approach**    | **Avoidance**    |

| **Task** | Task-Approach   | Task-Avoidance   |
| **Ego**  | Ego-Approach    | Ego-Avoidance    |

| **Ego**  | Striving to outperform others  | Striving to avoid doing worse than others   |

# Attribution Theory (Weiner, 1986)

_Attribution_: explanation for **why** something happened

--

This model categorizes explanations against 3 dimensions, each defined in two levels:
- **Locus of causality**
    - internal: due to individual characteristics
    - external: due to something not pertaining to the individual
- **Stability**
    - stable: it does not vary over time
    - unstable: it varies over time
- **Locus of control**
    - under own control: it can be changed by the individual
    - outside own control: it cannot be changed by the individual

| "We lost the game because the referee made bad calls." | External | Unstable | Outside own control |
| "I won the race because I have natural talent." | Internal | Stable | Outside own control |
| "The project succeeded because the team worked hard." | Internal | Unstable | Under own control |

# Memory tip

How to distinguish "Achievement Goal Theory" from "Attribution Theory". The former is concerned with the **what**, the latter with the **why**.

# Additional: Self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985)

Focuses on the degree to which human behavior is self-motivated and self-determined.

Three basic psychological needs:
- **Autonomy**: Feeling in control of one’s actions and decisions.
- **Competence**: Feeling effective and capable in one’s activities.
- **Relatedness**: Feeling connected to others and having a sense of belonging.

Very influential theory because it highlights the importance of basic psychological needs in fostering optimal functioning, well-being, and sustained engagement. It provides a framework for understanding how different types of motivation impact behavior and performance across various domains.

This theory will be more prominent in your year 2.
