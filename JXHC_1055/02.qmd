# Agenda

- some foundational concepts in motivation 
- a mixture of theory and intuition
- basics of Cognitive Evaluation Theory
- basics of Achievement Goal Theory
- basics of Attribution Theory
- experience collecting self-report data to measure a motivation construct


## Questionnaire activity (part 1) {.center}

Fill in the questionnare "Task and Ego orientation in Sport Questionnaire" (Duda, 1989). There is no right or wrong answer.

[We will compute the scores (page 2) later in the session]{.fragment} [and we will discuss what the scores mean]{.fragment}




# Intuitive understanding

**Approach** motivation refers to the tendency to move _towards_ a desired goal, reward, or positive outcome.

**Avoidance** motivation refers to the tendency to move _away from_ an undesired situation, threat, or negative outcome.

# Intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation 

|    | **Intrinsic** | **Extrinsic** |
|---:|---------------|---------------|
| purpose: activity...  | ...undertaken for its own pleasures | ...undertaken for instrumental benefits |
| reward: | experience itself | social or objective rewards (e.g., trophies, praise) |
| competitive pressure: | less pressure (concerned with the experience) | more pressure (concerned with the benefits) |

. . .

Examples of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation:

- Intrinsic: running because you enjoy the sensation and challenge
- Extrinsic: running to qualify for team selection, or to earn a bonus

<div style="font-size:90%">
An old man lived alone on a street where boys played noisily every afternoon. The din annoyed him, so one day he called the boys to his door. He told them he loved the cheerful sound of children’s voices and promised them each 50 cents if they would return the next day. Next afternoon the youngsters raced back and played more lustily than ever. The old man paid them and promised another reward the next day. Again they returned, whooping it up, and the man again paid them; this time 25 cents. The following day they got only 15 cents, and the man explained that his meager resources were being exhausted. “Please, though, would you come to play for 10 cents tomorrow?” The disappointed boys told the man they would not be back.

:::{.fragment fragment-index=3}
The _same_ reward can be interpreted as

- **controlling** (i.e., trying to influence their behaviour), resulting in decreased intrinsic motivation

- **informational** (i.e., providing constructive feedback), resulting in enhanced intrinsic motivation

# Which of these rewards are "controlling" and which are "informational"?

:::{.column width=35%}

:::{.fragment}
Well... it depends on your cognitive evaluation (interpretation)!

Further examples:

- A toddler's drawing activity becomes less enjoyable when rewards are introduced, as the focus shifts from the joy of drawing to earning the reward.

- Volunteering becomes less enjoyable when it transitions to a paid activity, as the focus shifts from intrinsic satisfaction to the external reward.

- Removing external rewards, such as points or badges, can renew interest in an activity when the activity itself is inherently enjoyable.


# Hierarchical Model of Intrinsic/Extrinsic Motivation (HMIEM, Lalande & Vallerand, 2014) {.scrollable}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
**Contextual** level: within specific life domains (e.g., work, school, relationships, sport).
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
**Situational** Level: Motivation in specific situation, moments, or tasks within a certain context (e.g., studying for a test today).

::: {.fragment fragment-index=5}
**Similarity across levels**. For example, high intrinsic motivation at the global level is associated with high intrinsic motivation at the contextual level
:::


# Small-group chats

1. Share an example from your own experience where your motivation changed from intrinsic to extrinsic (or vice versa). What triggered the change?

<br><br>

2. Think of an example from sport or exercise that fits all three hierarchical levels (just like in the table in the previous slide)
    - Global: Motivation across life
    - Contextual: Motivation within a specific sport or activity
    - Situational: Motivation in a specific moment or task within that sport

Two orientations (also known as "achievement goals"):

:::{.fragment}
Examples:

“I will try to beat my own best lap time today” [(Task orientation)]{.fragment}

“I want to finish ahead of my teammates today” [(Ego orientation)]{.fragment}
:::




---

The two orientations are associated with different behaviours and thoughts

| Orientation | Persistence (in spite of failure) | Moral behaviour | Perceived competence |
| --- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Task | high | high | stable |
| Ego  | low  | low  | unstable* |

*contingent on comparisons with others

Task orientation is not the same as intrinsic motivation, and ego orientation is not the same as extrinsic motivation.

Climates are environments that facilitates or impede the development of a certain personal orientation.

- **Task** climate: rewards and punishments are contingent to development and effort
- **Ego** climate: rewards and punishments are contingent to distance from desired outcome
:::
::::

---

Typically, an ego climate fosters ego orientation, and a task climate fosters task orientation.^[But it's possible to have a task orientation within an ego climate]

. . .

Examples of task-climate cues:

- Effort and improvement praised
- individual progress charts

. . .

Examples of ego-climate cues:

- Public leaderboard and comparison 
- mistakes punished publicly

# Imagine this scenario and discuss in small groups

:::{.column width=60%}
You are the psychologist of a _youth_ football club. [A football coach had **previously emphasized competition** among players, frequently posting public leaderboards and _rewarding_ only those who outperformed others. Over time, athletes began to focus solely on winning, felt anxious about mistakes, immoral behaviour increased, and reported enjoying the sport less.]{.fragment} [Realizing the negative impact, the coach now asked for your help. What would you do?]{.fragment} [(Hint: shift from ego to task climate)]{.fragment}
:::

:::{.column width=40%}

<div style="font-size:0.8em">
Here’s what you could do:

- Reward effort, improvement, and learning (e.g., through praises) rather than just outcomes
- Set individual progress goals and celebrate personal bests
- Introduce activities where success is measured by mastering new skills, not by comparison
- Reduce public comparisons and instead highlight collective achievements

Note: an ego climate _might_ be inappropriate in certain contexts (e.g., youth, leisure) but appropriate in other contexts (e.g., elite, competition)

# Attribution Theory (Weiner, 1986)

_Attribution_: explanation for **why** something happened

. . .

This model categorizes explanations against 3 dimensions, each defined in two levels:

- **Locus of causality**
    - internal: due to individual characteristics
    - external: due to something not pertaining to the individual
- **Stability**
    - stable: it does not vary over time
    - unstable: it varies over time
- **Locus of control**
    - under own control: it can be changed by the individual
    - outside own control: it cannot be changed by the individual


---


Examples of Attribution Theory


| **Scenario** | **Locus of Causality** | **Stability** | **Locus of Control** |
|-------------------------------|---------|----------|-----------------------|
| "I failed the test because I didn't study enough." | Internal | Unstable | Under own control |
| "We lost the game because the referee made bad calls." | External | Unstable | Outside own control |
| "I won the race because I have natural talent." | Internal | Stable | Outside own control |
| "The project succeeded because the team worked hard." | Internal | Unstable | Under own control |


# Memory tip

How to remember the distinction between "Achievement Goal Theory" and "Attribution Theory". 

:::{.fragment}
Both deal with successes and failures. The former is concerned with the **what**, the latter with the **why**.

# Additional and optional: Self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985)

Focuses on the degree to which human behavior is self-motivated and self-determined.

Three basic psychological needs:

- **Autonomy**: Feeling in control of one’s actions and decisions.
- **Competence**: Feeling effective and capable in one’s activities.
- **Relatedness**: Feeling connected to others and having a sense of belonging.

. . .

Very influential theory because it highlights the importance of basic psychological needs in fostering optimal functioning, well-being, and sustained engagement. It provides a framework for understanding _how different types of motivation impact behavior and performance_ across various domains.

::: aside
This theory will be more prominent in your year 2 (exercise psychology, e.g., motivations to exercise or to healthy lifestyle).
