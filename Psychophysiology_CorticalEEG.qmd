# Why study brain activity

Studying brain activity is useful for several purposes:

- **Understanding** how different brain regions contribute to various cognitive and motor functions.
- **Sleep** staging to distinguish the different phases of sleep.
- **Diagnosing** and monitoring neurological conditions such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, and brain injuries.
- **Enable brain-computer interfaces** that allow direct control of machines and external devices by controlling brain activity.
- **Therapies** for mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, and ADHD.

# Anatomical directions and planes

::::{.columns}

- **Anterior** (or rostral): towards the front (towards the face)
- **Posterior** (or caudal): towards the back (towards the tail)
- **Superior** (or dorsal): upwards
- **Inferior** (or ventral): downwards

- **Medial**: towards the midline
- **Ipsilateral**: same side
- **Contralateral**: opposite side

Anatomical planes (useful to imagine as slices):
- **Sagittal**: divides the brain into left and right
- **Coronal** (or frontal): divides the brain into anterior (rostral) and posterior (caudal)
- **Horizontal** (or transverse): divides the brain into superior (dorsal) and inferior (ventral)

# Cortical layers

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=55%}
The cerebral cortex is divided into six layers, each with distinct types of neurons and connections.
- Layer I: Contains mostly dendrites and axons.
- Layer II: Contains small pyramidal neurons.
- Layer III: Contains medium-sized pyramidal neurons.
- Layer IV: Contains various types of neurons.
- Layer V: Contains large pyramidal neurons, including Betz cells.
- Layer VI: Contains spindle-shaped neurons.

# Broadmann areas

Not only variations in cellular composition (cytoarchitecture) define the six cortical layers, but they also help identify different areas (Broadmann areas), each with distinct cellular structures and functions.

- Area 1, 2, 3: Primary somatosensory cortex.
- Area 4: Primary motor cortex.
- Area 17: Primary visual cortex.
- Area 22: Part of the superior temporal gyrus, involved in auditory processing.
- Area 44, 45: Broca's area, involved in language production.

# Cortex mapping

There are several examples of mapping (e.g., retinotopic, tonotopic, somatotopic).

Somatotopic mapping: organization of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and primary motor cortex (M1) where different parts of the body are represented in specific cortical areas. This is often illustrated by the sensory and motor homunculus, which shows the disproportionate representation of body parts based on their sensory and motor importance.

# Dipoles

- Dipoles can be detected from the scalp as voltage differences.

# Dipoles

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=55%}
- **Radial dipoles**: Oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface, often generated by pyramidal neurons in the gyri. These dipoles are more likely to be detected from electrodes on the scalp because their orientation aligns with the electrodes on the scalp.
- **Tangential dipoles**: Oriented parallel to the cortical surface, often found in the walls of the sulci. These dipoles are less likely to be detected by electrodes on the scalp as their orientation does not align well with the scalp.
- Both types of dipoles contribute to the overall EEG signal, but radial dipoles generally have a stronger influence due to their alignment with the scalp surface.

# Main parameters of waveforms

![](../JXH3089/images/waveformParameters.png){width="55%" fig-align="center"}

- **Frequency**: The number of cycles the waveform completes in a given time period, usually measured in Hertz (Hz). Higher frequency indicates more cycles per second.
- **Phase**: The position of a point in time on the waveform cycle, indicating the timing of the waveform relative to a reference point. Phase differences can affect how waveforms interact with each other.
- **Amplitude**: The height of the waveform, representing the strength or intensity of the signal. Higher amplitude indicates stronger signals.

# 10-20 system

An internationally recognized method to describe the location of scalp electrodes.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=55%}
- Electrodes are placed at intervals of 10% or 20% of the total distance between specified skull landmarks.
- Common landmarks include the nasion (bridge of the nose), inion (bump at the back of the skull), and preauricular points (just in front of the ears).
- Electrode positions are labeled with letters and numbers, where letters correspond to brain regions (e.g., F for frontal, T for temporal) and numbers indicate the hemisphere (odd numbers for the left, even numbers for the right).
- It can be expanded to include additional electrodes for higher resolution recordings, known as the 10-10 or 10-5 systems.

# Electrical reference

Reminder: one electrode alone cannot measure anything. You need two electrodes to measure voltage.

- **Bipolar montage**:
    - Each electrode is referenced to an adjacent electrode.
    - Measures the voltage difference between pairs of electrodes.
    - Useful for detecting localized activity.
    - Can help reduce common noise.

- **Monopolar (or referential) montage**:
    - Each electrode is referenced to a common reference electrode.
    - Measures the voltage difference between each electrode and the reference.
    - Provides a broader view of brain activity.
    - Common reference points include the mastoids, earlobes, or an average of all electrodes.

- Eye movements: blinks and saccades, especially in the frontal region.
- Muscle activity: tension or movements in the scalp, neck, or face muscles can introduce high-frequency noise.
- Electrode movement: shifts in electrode position can cause sudden changes in the recorded signal.
- Sweat: changes in skin conductance can affect low-frequency characteristics.
- Heartbeats: electrical activity of the heart (e.g., R-waves, pulse waves).
- Environmental noise: electrical interference from nearby equipment or power lines can introduce 50/60 Hz noise.

# Brain rhythms

![](../JXH3089/images/eegPrism.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

Spectral decomposition breaks down the complex EEG signal into its constituent frequency components. This process facilitates analysis of the different brain rhythms and their contributions to the overall signal.

# Brain rhythms

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- **Alpha waves (8-12 Hz)**: associated with neuronal suppression (e.g., cognitive activity, relaxation).
- **Beta waves (12-30 Hz)**: associated with alertness, concentration, and active thinking; can be increased by stress, anxiety, or mental effort.
- **Delta waves (0.5-4 Hz)**: predominantly seen during deep sleep.
:::
:::{.column width=50%}
- **Theta waves (4-8 Hz)**: associated with executive functions (inhibition, updating, shifting); more prominent in the frontal regions.
- **Gamma waves (30-100 Hz)**: associated with neuronal excitations.
- **Mu waves (8-13 Hz)**: similar to alpha waves but more localized to the sensorimotor cortex; associated with motor planning and execution.
