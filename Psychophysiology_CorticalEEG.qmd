# Objectives

Being able to elaborate:

- biological source of the EEG signal
- metrics that can be obtained from the EEG signal

# Why study brain activity

Studying brain activity is useful for several purposes:

- **Understanding** how different brain regions contribute to various cognitive and motor functions.
- **Sleep** staging to distinguish the different phases of sleep.
- **Diagnosing** and monitoring neurological conditions such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, and brain injuries.
- **Enable brain-computer interfaces** that allow direct control of machines and external devices by controlling brain activity.
- **Therapies** for mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, and ADHD.

# Anatomical directions

::::{.columns}

- **Anterior** (or rostral): towards the front (towards the face)
- **Posterior** (or caudal): towards the back (towards the tail)
- **Superior** (or dorsal): upwards

- **Lateral**: towards the side
- **Medial**: towards the midline
- **Ipsilateral**: same side

# Anatomical planes

::::{.columns}

Anatomical planes (useful to imagine as slices):

- **Sagittal** (midsagittal): vertical plane through the midline, dividing brain into left and right hemispheres
- **Parasagittal**: vertical plane parallel to the midline, dividing left and right but off-center
- **Coronal** (or frontal): vertical plane perpendicular to the midline, dividing anterior (rostral) and posterior (caudal)
- **Transverse** (or horizontal): horizontal plane dividing superior (dorsal) and inferior (ventral)

# Key concepts about the brain {.scrollable}

Key neuronal structures:

- **Dendrites**: Receive signals and generate postsynaptic potentials (PSPs)
- **Soma**: Integrates incoming PSPs from dendrites
- **Axon**: Transmits action potentials (AP) away from soma

Key potentials:

- **Postsynaptic potentials (PSP)**: Slower (hundreds of ms) and graded (their amplitude varies with input strength).
- **Action potentials (AP)**: Very fast (~1-2 ms duration) and all-or-none (same amplitude regardless of input strength).

Key neuron type:

[**Pyramidal neurons**: an important type of cortical neuron.]{.fragment} [They are the most abundant excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex.]{.fragment} [Their connections reach across different layers of the cortex and to other brain regions.]{.fragment} [Their dendrites are aligned perpendicular to the cortical surface.]{.fragment}


:::aside
If you are not familiar with these concepts, I recommend reviewing the basics of neuroscience before proceeding. Check "Foundations of the Brain" on [learning material](https://germanogallicchio.github.io/learning/)

# Dipoles in the brain

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=40%}
- Electrochemical activity in the dendrites generates electric fields.
- These fields create dipoles due to the separation of charges.
:::

:::

# Summation of dipoles {.scrollable}

Each neuronal activity generates a dipole. [But most individual dipoles are too _small_ to be detected from the scalp.]{.fragment} [However, when thousands of nearby neurons fire in synchronous, aligned activity, their individual dipoles **summate** into a bigger dipole and create a measurable electrical signal which is the foundation of EEG.]{.fragment}

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}

[Summation in _time_:]{.fragment}

- Dipoles must be active synchronously. [Which type of potential (between PSPs and APs) is more likely to overlap in time?]{.fragment} [PSPs, because they are slower and can last hundreds of milliseconds, while APs are very brief (1-2 ms).]{.fragment} 

- Dipoles must be active for a sustained period. [Brief, transient activity may not produce a strong enough signal to be detected at the scalp.]{.fragment} 
:::

:::{.column width=50%}

[Summation in _space_:]{.fragment}

- Dipoles need to be aligned in the same direction. [Dipoles that are not perfectly aligned but are close in orientation will summate less effectively.]{.fragment} [Dipoles that are oriented in opposite directions will cancel each other out.]{.fragment}

- Dipoles need to be close enough to each other (local population) to summate effectively. [Distant dipoles may not contribute significantly to the scalp signal due to spatial attenuation.]{.fragment}

# Detecting dipoles from the scalp

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=45%}
Electric fields propagate through the tissues (volume conduction), allowing us to detect the activity of neuronal populations from electrodes placed on the scalp. 

Several dipoles can be detected simultaneously. 

We can observe scalp activity but it is challenging to determine the exact location of the underlying dipoles (so called, inverse problem).

# Types of dipoles detectable from the scalp {.scrollable}

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=65%}
- **Radial dipoles**: Oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface, often generated by pyramidal neurons in the gyri. These dipoles are more likely to be detected from electrodes on the scalp because their orientation aligns with the electrodes on the scalp.
- **Tangential dipoles**: Oriented parallel to the cortical surface, often found in the walls of the sulci. These dipoles are less likely to be detected by electrodes on the scalp as their orientation does not align well with the scalp.
:::
:::{.column width=35%}
![](./Psychophysiology_files/neuronsDipolesCortexEEG.png){width="90%" fig-align="center" .lightbox}
:::
::::

- Both types of dipoles contribute to the overall EEG signal, but radial dipoles generally have a stronger influence due to their alignment with the scalp surface.

Characteristics of the EEG

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=45%}
Advantages:

- Noninvasive
- Portable (easy to set up and transport)
- High temporal resolution (captures fast neural dynamics)
- Measures neuronal activity 
- Relatively low cost 

:::
:::{.column width=55%}

Limitations:

- Poor spatial resolution (signals spread across scalp due to volume conduction)
- Inverse problem (difficulty in localizing sources of activity)
- Limited to cerebral cortex (not deeper structures)
- Susceptible to artifacts (e.g., eye movements, muscle activity)

:::

# Biological source of the EEG signal

EEG signals comes mainly from _postsynaptic potentials (PSPs)_ [of _pyramidal neurons_ in the cerebral cortex. This is because:]{.fragment}

- PSPs are slower and can overlap in time, allowing for temporal summation.
- Pyramidal neurons are abundant and have an aligned architecture, which allows for spatial summation of their dipoles.

[EEG captures rhythmic, coordinated brain activity and not isolated/localized neuronal firing.]{.fragment}

# EEG signal morphology

EEG signals appear like complex waveforms[, consisting of multiple overlapping waveforms]{.fragment} [that vary in frequency, phase, and amplitude.]{.fragment}

# The three main parameters of waveforms {.nostretch .scrollable}

![](./Psychophysiology_files/waveformParameters.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" .lightbox}

- **Frequency**: The number of cycles the waveform completes in a given time period, usually measured in Hertz (Hz). Higher frequency indicates more cycles per second.
- **Phase**: The position of a point in time on the waveform cycle, indicating the timing of the waveform relative to a reference point. Phase differences can affect how waveforms interact with each other.
- **Amplitude**: The height of the waveform, representing the strength or intensity of the signal. Higher amplitude indicates stronger signals.

# Electrical reference {.scrollable}

Reminder: voltage is difference in electrical potential between two points. Therefore, one electrode alone cannot measure anything. You need two electrodes to measure voltage.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- **Bipolar montage**:
    - Each electrode is referenced to an adjacent electrode.
    - Measures the voltage difference between pairs of electrodes.
    - Useful for detecting localized activity.
    - Commonly used in clinical settings to identify focal seizures (e.g., epilepsy).

:::
:::{.column width=50%}

- **Monopolar (or referential) montage**:
    - Each electrode is referenced to a common reference electrode.
    - Measures the voltage difference between each electrode and the reference.
    - Provides a broader view of brain activity.
    - Common reference points include the mastoids, earlobes, or an average of all electrodes.

Commonly known as "artifacts".

They are of non-neural origin and can contaminate the EEG signal and obscure the underlying brain activity.


:::
::::

- Eye movements: blinks and saccades, especially in the frontal region.
- Muscle activity: tension or movements in the scalp, neck, or face muscles can introduce high-frequency noise.
- Electrode movement: shifts in electrode position can cause sudden changes in the recorded signal.
- Sweat: changes in skin conductance can affect low-frequency characteristics.
- Heartbeats: electrical activity of the heart (e.g., R-waves, pulse waves).
- Environmental noise: electrical interference from nearby equipment or power lines can introduce 50/60 Hz noise.
