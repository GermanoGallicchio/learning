# Discipline location in relation with Sport Science and Psychology

Sport and exercise psychology lives in the _intersection_ of sport and exercise science and psychological science

# Two objectives

We will review in turn each of the two objectives: sport and exercise.

    rankdir=LR
    bgcolor="transparent"
    A [label="sport"];
    B [label="exercise"];
    A -> B
    B -> A
}
```


# Objective: Sport psychology

Understand the effects of psychological factors on physical or motor performance.

Examples:

- What are the effects of anxiety on basketball free-throwing 
accuracy?
- Does greater self-confidence improve a child’s ability to learn to 
swim?
- Do psychological skills (e.g., imagery) facilitate injury recovery



# Objective: Exercise Psychology
Understand the effects of physical activity on psychological development, health, and well-being.

Examples:

- Does running reduce anxiety and depression?
- Does taking physical education classes improve a child’s self-esteem?
- Do children become more aggressive by participating in youth 
sports?


# Target populations

Children

People with disabilities

Elderly

Recreational athletes

Elite athletes

Video 1 is on an elite sport application.
Videos 2 and 3 are about selective attention (which will a later topic this semester).

# Development of sport and exercise psychology (scrollable slide) {.scrollable}

**Early years**

- 1890-1920s
- Philosophical perspective
- Experimental perspective
- E.g., Why do cyclists ride faster when racing in groups than individually?


**First laboratory testing**

- 1920-40s
- Development of laboratories in 
- various western countries
- Testing athletes on reaction times, concentration, aggression, etc


**Preparation for the future**

- 1940-60s
- University professors teaching sport and exercise psychology
-First consultants hired by professional athletic teams



**Academic discipline**

- 1960-80s
- Kinesiology (sport and exercise 
science) becomes a discipline 
- Sport and exercise psychology as 
part of kinesiology



**Multidisciplinary science and practice**

- 1980-90s
- Sport and exercise psychology 
becomes a separate discipline
- Specialty scientific societies and 
journals



**Contemporary sport and exercise psychology**

- 2000-present
- Exponential growth
- Esteemed academic discipline
- Recognised practical importance
- Driving knowledge in other fields




# Review questions

Discuss in small groups

1. Think of **examples** of sport and exercise psychology science or practice that you have come across.

2. What is sport and exercise psychology? What are its two **objectives**?

3. Describe the three main **roles** of sport and exercise psychology specialists

    <text x="65%" y="50%" text-anchor="middle" fill="black" font-size="1em">Practice</text>
</svg>



**Tenets** of the scientific method:

- Systematic approach to studying a question
- Control/manipulation of conditions
- Empirical (based on observations)
- Objective evidence and not opinions
- Critical analysis of measurements and ideas

:::{.fragment}
A major objective of the application of the scientific method is the development of a **theory**

What is a **theory**?
:::

- Not a speculative guess...
- ...but a set of interrelated facts on a certain phenomenon
- Describes the **what** of a certain phenomenon
- Explains the **how** and **why** of its mechanisms
- Supported by **empirical evidence**
- Makes **testable predictions**

    <text x="65%" y="50%" text-anchor="middle" fill="black" font-size="1em">Practice</text>
</svg>

- Guided by trial-and-error learning
- Based on systematic observation, personal experience, introspection, intuition, …and scientific method


Compared to scientific knowledge:

- More holistic (global)
- Quicker to implement novel ideas
- Produces fewer or no explanations
- Affected by bias and less reliable

# Critical reflections | small-group activity

You are interested in studying the effects of two strategies of penalty taking in football/soccer.

:::{.fragment}
**Strategy A.** Pick a target and ignore any goal-keeper’s movements
:::

:::{.fragment}
**Strategy B.** Observe the goal-keeper movements during the run-up and then decide where to place the ball
:::

:::{.fragment}
How would you design an experimental study to test which strategy leads to better performance outcome?

Think about participants, Instructions, Measurements, Groups/Conditions, Analysis
