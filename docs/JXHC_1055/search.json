Over time, athletes began to focus solely on winning, felt anxious about mistakes, and reported enjoying the sport less.\nRealizing the negative impact, the coach now wants to foster a task climate. Here’s what they can do:\n\nPraise effort, improvement, and learning rather than just outcomes.\nSet individual progress goals and celebrate personal bests.\nUse private feedback focused on skill development.\nEncourage teamwork and cooperation in training.\nIntroduce activities where success is measured by mastering new skills, not by comparison.\nReduce public comparisons and instead highlight collective achievements.\n\nBy making these changes, the coach can help athletes regain enjoyment and motivation through personal growth and mastery."

    "text": "Additional notes on Phineas Gage\nModern lesion reconstructions suggest the accident damaged ventromedial/orbitofrontal regions rather than the whole prefrontal cortex.\nThis helps explain changes in emotion regulation and social decision‑making more than pure working memory deficits.\n\nTypical post‑accident changes reported: . These map well to vmPFC/OFC dysfunction in contemporary models.\nImportant nuances:\n\nReports come from historical case notes (Harlow and others) and vary in detail; some later evidence suggests partial recovery and preserved basic functions (he worked as a stagecoach driver for a time).\nSingle‑case narratives are powerful but limited — modern neuropsychology uses lesion groups, neuroimaging and tasks (e.g., Iowa Gambling Task) to test hypotheses derived from Gage’s case.\nOther factors (seizures, infection, social reactions) may have contributed to behavioural changes; avoid over‑simplifying the story.\n\nWhy the case matters:\n\nIt was a landmark demonstration linking frontal damage to changes in personality and social behaviour, spurring the development of cognitive neuroscience of frontal lobes.\nIt motivates contrasts between dorsolateral (executive control, working memory) and ventromedial/orbitofrontal (value, emotion, decision) frontal functions.\n\nTeaching suggestions:\n\nShow a lesion reconstruction image and contrast expected deficits for vmPFC vs DLPFC lesions.\nUse the case to introduce concepts like affective decision‑making, somatic‑marker ideas, and the limits of single‑case evidence.\nEmphasise historical context and caution about simplistic “moral of the story” interpretations.\n\n\nReferences (for slides/reading): Harlow (1868) clinical report; modern reviews/reconstructions (e.g., Damasio and colleagues; neuroanatomical reconstructions)."
