# Agenda

- Eye movements
- Extraocular muscles
- The eye as a dipole
- Electrooculography (EOG)
- Biological sources of the EOG
- EOG signal characteristics
- EOG metrics
- EOG limitations and future directions

# Why study eye movements

Studying eye movements is useful in sevarl domains. Some examples:

- **Research**: Understanding more functioning (e.g., association between eye movements and cognitive processes at rest or during tasks such as reading, driving, sport)
- **Sleep**: Distinguishing different stages of sleep, particularly REM sleep.
- **Human-computer interface**: Enabling  hands-free systems for controlling computers and other devices (e.g., wheelchair, speller).
- **Fatigue and sleepiness monitoring**: Monitor drowsiness while driving (e.g., transport, military).
- **Sport**: Analyzing athletes' eye movements to improve performance and training techniques.

# Photoreceptors in the retina

The retina contains two types of photoreceptors:

|  | Rods | Cones |
|---------|------|-------|
| main location | Peripheral retina | Central retina, especially fovea |
| light sensitivity | Highly sensitive | Less light-sensitive |
| motion sensitivity | high | low |
| colour | no (monochromatic) | yes (color vision) |


Density distribution and density varies across the retina:

- Periphery: Mostly rods so better motion detection and night vision
- Fovea: Mostly cones and with high density so sharp and colored vision


# Types of eye movements

- ⚡ Saccades
- 🎯 Fixational movements 
- 🌊 Smooth movements
- 🚂 Nystagmus 
 

# ⚡ Saccades 

- Quick jumps from one fixation point to another
- They allow to _foveate_ objects or locations
  - foveate = direct the eyes so that image of interest in reflected in the part of the retina with most photoreceptors called fovea
- One of the fastest human movements, with angular speed  up to 700°/s

# 🎯 Fixational movements 

>Far from being a quiet interlude between eye movements, fixation is a lively period of continuous albeit microscopic motion, full of complex interactions that we are just beginning to understand.<br><br>
Krauzlis et al. (2017)

[Mostly involuntary.]{.fragment}
[Their main function: avoiding retinal image fading.]{.fragment}
[Several types:]{.fragment}

- _Microsaccades_ (tiny jerky movements)
- _Tremor_ (rapid oscillations)
- _Drift_ (slow wandering movements)

# 🌊 Smooth movements

Slow movements of the eyes to allow fixation under moving conditions. [Two types:]{.fragment}

- _smooth pursuit movements_ The eyes track a moving object through slow conjugate movements. The head might be still. [(Try... you can't without anything to track.)]{.fragment}

- _smooth compensatory movements_ The eyes fixate on a still object but the head and/or the body move [(Try... pick a point and move your head)]{.fragment}

# Muscular control of the eyes {.nostretch .scrollable}

Six muscles attached to the outer surface of each eye

![Extraocular muscles](./Psychophysiology_files/extraocularMuscles_wikimedia1412.jpg){width=90%}

Each muscle pair is mostly associated with one movment type:

However, in practice, all muscles contribute to all movements.

# Measuring eye movements

In principle, we could measure the activity of the extraocular muscles to understand in which directions the eyes are moving.

[But it is very impractical to record this activity: it would require invasive electrodes.]{.fragment} [Also, the muscles are small and close to each other, and contribute to multiple movement types, making it difficult to isolate their activity.]{.fragment}

[There are other techniques for measuring eye movements. One of these, the electrooculogram, exploits an electrical property of the eyes: the eye **dipole**.]{.fragment}

# The eye as a dipole {.nostretch .scrollable}

:::
:::{.column width=40%}

- The retina (or fundus) is electrically more negatively charged than the cornea. 

- Why? The greater negativity in the retina is due to metabolic activity due to photoreceptors and other neurons.

- This creates a potential, called **_corneoretinal_ (or corneofundal) potential**. This potential forms a dipole.

:::
::::

# More on the eye dipole

- The eye dipole is **aligned** with the optical axis of the eye, from the retina outward the cornea. Its positive side points at what we are looking. Its negative side points in the opposite diretion.

- The corneoretinal potential is **dynamic**. It mainly depends on ambient light. [In darkness or with eyes closed, photoreceptors are less/not active leaading to lower metabolic activity. The dipole decreases in magnitude.]{.fragment} [Changes in the corneoretinal potential are slow. The corneoretinal potential is relatively stable over minutes.]{.fragment}

- **Electrodes** placed around the eyes can detect changes to the orientation of the eye dipole.

# Measuring changes to the dipole{.scrollable}

Assume you place two electrodes, one left and one right of the eyes.

# Montage options: Bipolar channels {.scrollable}

When two electrodes are referenced to one another, their montage is called _bipolar_. In a bipolar montage, the voltage reflects the difference in electrical potential between the two sites.

**Horizontal EOG channel**:

When computing it as left - right, eye movement to the left/right = increased/decreased voltage

$$
hEOG = LO1-LO2
$$

**Vertical EOG channel**

We can compute two vertical channels, one per eye, and then average them.

$$
vEOG_{left} = SO1 - IO1
$$

$$
vEOG_{right} = SO2 - IO2
$$

$$
vEOG = \frac{vEOG_{left}+vEOG_{right}}{2}
$$



# Impact of high-pass filtering {.scrollable}

High-pass filtering is not recommended when studying eye movements. But many systems apply high-pass filtering (it's simpler). 

[The high-pass filter reduces _slow trends_ and retains faster changes.]{.fragment}

[Consider an EOG signal (with saccades and fixations).]{.fragment} [Applying high-pass filter makes the EOG signal less "square".]{.fragment} [This is as if only the initial changes are detected or only the quick changes that happen (keeping eyes still can be considered like an extremely slow change).]{.fragment}

[For example, voltage increases as you move the eyes up. You would expect the voltage to not change is you maintain your eyes in that position.]{.fragment} [But when high-pass filtering is applied, the voltage goes gradually back to baseline even if the eyes are still up.]{.fragment}

# EOG calibration {.scrollable}

The native units of the EOG are _Volts_, but eye movements are better described as _visual angles_. Eye movements are angular in nature.

**Calibration** allows to calculate how many Volts correspond to 1 degree of visual angle, so that we can convert our EOG recording from Volts to degrees.

![EOG calibration: acquisition](./Psychophysiology_files/eogCalibration.png){width=100%}

![EOG calibration: processing](./Psychophysiology_files/eogCalibration2.png){width=100%}

# Calibrated EOG {.nostretch .scrollable}

The EOG signal is now represented in degrees of visual angle.

The figure shows **horizontal**, **vertical**, and **combined** EOG signals, in the seconds before the execution of a golf putt. 

The combined signal is computed as the vectorial sum of the calibrated horizontal and vertical signals.

![Calibrated EOG](./Psychophysiology_files/eogCalibrated.jpg){width=100%}

Because the source of the EOG (the corneoretinal potential) is not fixed, calibration should be done regularly unless the recording session is very short.


# EOG eye movement metrics {.scrollable}

Several metrics can be extracted from the EOG signal to characterize eye movements:

- saccades: 
  - number
  - extent
  - velocity

- fixations
  - number
  - duration

- Quiet Eye durations (popular in sport tasks)

# EOG Blink wave characteristics

- Typical duration: 200-400 ms
- Biphasic pattern
  - Initial positive deflection
  - Followed by negative component
- Amplitude typically larger than saccades
- More prominent in vertical than horizontal channels

# Physiological source of the EOG blink 

Not as well understood as the source of eye movements.

Initially thought to be due to upward rotation of the eyeball (i.e., rapid dipole rotation)

More recently thought to be due to eyelid bridging the corneoretinal positivity with the forehead (changes in electrical conductivity).


# EOG Blink metrics {.scrollable}

Several metrics can be extracted from the EOG signal to characterize blinking behavior:

- **Number of blinks**: Total count of blinks during a recording period.

- **Blink rate**: Number of blinks per minute, a commonly reported metric in psychophysiology research.

- **Blink duration**: Time duration of individual blinks, typically measured from initial positive deflection to return to baseline (200-400 ms range).

- **Blink flurries**: Clusters of rapid successive blinks occurring in quick succession, often associated with cognitive load or fatigue.

- **Flurry rate**: Frequency of blink flurries per minute, reflecting periods of increased blinking activity.

[These metrics are useful for assessing cognitive workload, fatigue, attention, and other psychological states during task performance or resting conditions.]{.fragment}


# EOG Limitations

While EOG is a useful technique, it has some limitations:

- **Signal noise**: EOG signals can be affected by electrical noise from other sources, such as muscle activity and external electronic devices.

- **Artifact contamination**: Blinks and other involuntary eye movements can introduce artifacts into the EOG signal, complicating data analysis.

- **Head movement confounders**: EOG saccadic signals reflect movements of the eyeballs _relative to the head_. By looking at the EOG only or without behavioural constrains, it is difficult to know whether the eyes, the head, or both have moved. 

- **Limited spatial resolution**: EOG provides less precise information about the exact point of gaze compared to other eye-tracking methods, such as video-based eye trackers.

- **Calibration drift**: The corneoretinal potential can change over time, requiring frequent recalibration.


# Future Directions {.scrollable}

Research and development in EOG technology are ongoing, with several promising directions:

- **Improved signal processing**: Developing advanced algorithms to reduce noise and artifacts in EOG signals. A promising technique is median filtering.

- **Integration with other modalities**: Combining EOG with other physiological measurements, such as EEG and EMG, for a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior.

- **Wearable EOG devices**: Creating portable and user-friendly EOG systems for real-world applications, such as sports training and assistive technology.
